Not only does the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier face a stronger Verizon Wireless division unified under a single owner, it also has to deal with the emergent prospects for the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers in the market. Even promising sales of new smartphones haven't turned things around for AT&T, and until it makes its intentions clear on how it expects to boost growth going forward, investors will remain wary.|0|"AT&T"|0

With high levels of capital expenditures required to continually build out and upgrade the network, Sprint suffers from a sparser 4G coverage area than Verizon or AT&T. While Sprint is less expensive than its competitors, customers pay for that discount through lesser coverage.|This deal acts as a way to keep parents with Sprint from switching to Verizon or AT&T, offering a deal which saves them quite a bit of money if they were planning to get phones for their children. Even with a free subsidized phone, a $70 per month plan comes out to $840 per year. This compares to less than $300 for a phone under the promotion.|0|"AT&T"|1

Indeed, that route is somewhat unusual, because while Milan is a large business market, it is underserved because of Alitalia's decision to locate its main hub in Rome instead. This created an opening for Emirates to fill a very large plane (a Boeing 777-300ER) without relying on the connecting volume of its Dubai hub.|United flies Boeing 757s like this one on many international routes.|On the other hand, for lower-volume routes (especially to Europe), U.S. carriers use smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 757 or 767. The 757 typically seats fewer than 200 passengers in an international configuration, whereas most of Emirates' planes have 300 to 500 seats. If a carrier like United can only fill a 757 for an international flight, despite having a large hub at Newark Airport to generate passenger "feed," Emirates doesn't have a prayer of filling a much larger 777.|0|"Boeing"|6

Boeing is also a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reflecting its importance to the American economy. Headquartered in Chicago, the company serves both commercial and military customers in over 150 countries, and is one of the largest U.S. exporters by sales. Boeing's Next-Generation 737 tends to be the world's most popular jet airliner, and most of its other jets are mainstays on airport tarmacs around the world as well.|Founded in 1925, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is the world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, and ranked among the top 50 Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. for 2012. Caterpillar is also a component of both the Dow. Headquartered in Peoria, Ill., Caterpillar traces its roots from the merger of the Holt Manufacturing Company and the C.L. Best Tractor Company. The company has grown through a number of acquisitions over the past decade, including Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi in 2008, Caterpillar Xuzhou and MWM Holding in 2010 and Bucyrus International in 2011.

This one's an easy win for Boeing.|Winner: Boeing, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak)According to Dividata, Boeing has been increasing its dividend payouts at least once per year since 2004, but the company held its dividends firm between 2010 and 2011. By contrast, Caterpillar's increased its dividend payments at least once every year since 1994, which lets it win the stability crown without any hassles.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Boeing has a better shot at long-term outperformance. Both companies face unique macroeconomic headwinds over the coming decade, but Caterpillar's increasing reliance on mining -- a floundering sector -- and its historical dependence on construction growth are both major drawbacks in a world where construction has stalled and commodity prices have plunged. Despite major defense cutbacks and glitches in the next-gen 787, Boeing still stands to gain from the continued surge in long-distance flights around the world, particularly in regions that are just now beginning to enjoy significant middle-class expansions.

The heavy-equipment maker has suffered greatly from slowing growth in emerging markets, as construction and infrastructure activity starts to ramp down from previous levels. Moreover, the plunge in commodities prices earlier this year hurt its mining-equipment demand, and cash-strapped mining companies are unlikely to spend as much on capital expenditures as they did when prices were soaring.

Having won its latest settlements to resolve litigation against Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , TiVo faces the daunting task of figure out how to make money from its ongoing operating business rather than relying on a series of litigation efforts to reap big cash awards.|TiVo was a pioneer in the DVR world, and its legal victories against Google and Cisco stemmed in part from their alleged failure to give TiVo as much credit as it was due from its role in creating DVR-enabling technology. But now that the big-money settlements have come in, the big question is whether licensing revenue from its arrangements with various other companies will bring in enough revenue for TiVo to stay profitable. How will TiVo grow from here? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with TiVo over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|The big push in TiVo earnings lately has come from huge settlements with Cisco Systems and Google. In June, the two companies settled claims that they had illegally infringed on TiVo's patents for its digital video recorder technology. By making upfront payments of $490 million under the settlements, Google and Cisco were singlehandedly responsible for giving TiVo's the biggest profit in its history.|What's important to realize, though, is that TiVo will keep getting money from the tech giants well into the future. In its second-quarter earnings report, TiVo released details on how it will keep receiving settlement money through 2019, with Google and Cisco responsible for most of the future income.|0|"Cisco Systems"|0

By linking the agronomy software of the chemical giant's Pioneer seed division with the farm-equipment maker's wireless-data-transfer architecture, the two want to transform how farmers access data on grain moisture, historical yields, and nutrient deficiencies in their soil so they can know where, when, and how best to plant their seed.|Still, as more farmers adopt these advanced farming technologies, it lowers the bar of resistance. Net farm income is predicted to hit its highest levels in 40 years, making technologically advanced farming equipment like the sort Deere manufactures a lucrative space for growth. Analysts say industrywide sales will grow 3% annually through 2017, with revenues widening at a 5% to 10% pace. The Asia-Pacific region alone is expected to adopt advanced crop-management practices at a compounded annual growth rate of 25% over the next few years. Deere's partnership with DuPont could increase its acceptability.|DuPont has already mapped 20 million acres of farmland in the past year from which it provided 1.5 million acres of variable-rate-seeding prescriptions. While it charges $500 per farm, DuPont plans to boost the price next year after implementing system upgrades, and Monsanto says it will start charging $10 per acre for its precision-planting product.|DuPont's Pioneer division offers crop insurance through PHI, as does Deere through its financial-services arm. Archer-Daniels Midland acquired ADM Crop Risk Services in 2010, which allows it to sell and service policies to farmers, and now that Monsanto has joined the fray, a big data critical mass has formed that can be twisted into a precision financial product.|DuPont Management may try to tackle Monsanto, but it's too late for this troubled Delaware-based conglomerate with identity-confusion and in the midst of splitting apart to copycat Monsanto successfully. Once the largest and leading innovator in seeds in the world, Pioneer gave up its seat over the past decade to Monsanto by virtue of blundering and missed strategic opportunities by DuPont Management. Recall DuPont's first major attempt to develop and commercialise a first-generation genetically-modified seed trait (DuPont OptimumGAP) ended in embarrassing failure. After unsuccessful patent litigation against Monsanto, DuPont has ended up paying Monsanto hundreds of $millions a year in license fees in order to embed Pioneer's otherwise inferior seed-line-up with Monsanto's superior GM traits.|Even with the help of Deere, DuPont will continue to be an also-ran, lagging Monsanto in seeds, and lagging Syngenta in crop protection chemicals.|As a Deere shareholder, we have serious concerns the disreputation of DuPont in agriculture will taint Deere. Witness the colossal DuPont Imprelis consumer product fraud, which has consumed already $1.2 billion in charges against DuPont earnings, with thousands of legal claims still pending in various courts throughout the nation. Ms. Kullman, DuPont Chieftess and her TEAM have commanded and delivered the largest, most costly new product failure and ensuing environmental disaster in 21st century corporate America. Hundreds of thousands of mature landscaping trees have been killed by DuPont's insidiously toxic dandelion lawn treatment, which was marketed deceptively by DuPont Management as "very environmentally friendly", "low impact".|Oh great headline. I had thought that someone was going to squash the GMO seed and have a giant push for organic whole foods, boy was I wrong. Now another conglomerate wants to ruin our food so they can get more profit. Now boycott Monsanto, DuPont, JohnDeere, anyone who peddles these companies products, anyone who uses them, or any food product made from these farmed items.|We will assume that Deere Director, Chad O.

Is DuPont piggybacking on Deere's superior reputation and outstanding leadership in its business?|0|"DuPont"|0

For that same amount of money, Buffett then said that could buy all American cropland, plus 16 ExxonMobils (NYSE: XOM) , and still have $1 trillion left over.|A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops -- and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. ExxonMobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons).

Just recently, Berkshire Hathaway announced a new, multibillion-dollar position in the energy company.|We obviously don't know if Buffett was sizing up the company in 2012 for an investment.

However, this isn't the first time that soft drinks-to-financials conglomerate has invested in an integrated oil company. When Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) to 5.7% in 2008, the energy company was still functioning as an integrated oil and gas major.|Is something similar suspected at Exxon? The question that Fools need to ask is: What exactly did Buffett have in mind when he acquired a stake in ExxonMobil last week? Is something similar expected at Exxon? Let's explore.|For more than a century, the integrated structure of oil and gas companies has been arguably among the most profitable undertakings in any industry. It's no surprise that the hugely successful Standard Oil had to be broken up in 1911 because of an increasingly monopolistic hold within the industry. The seven successor companies -- having evolved under various mergers and acquisitions -- have been highly profitable, too.

In short, the integrated structure served the oil and gas business extremely well.|Will Exxon divest its refining arm? The big question now is: Will ExxonMobil divest its refining arm? The company has underperformed the broader markets for the last few years. Despite an increase in production from last year, earnings slipped thanks to disastrous refining margins, thus bringing into question the integrated model. Growth has been an issue. Here how Exxon's total returns compare with the S&P 500 for the past five years:|Traditionally, Exxon has been a good allocator of capital with impressive returns, which is probably what caught Buffett's attention in the first place. However, growth looks limited at this point unless a spinoff is on the cards. I can't see why the markets have been otherwise undervaluing an excellent company.|Getting gassy and exploring new frontiersThrough its acquisition of XTO Energy in 2009, Exxon has natural gas making up 49% of its total reserves. While natural gas may not garner a lot of attention from the market in the short run, global demand for this commodity is huge in the long run. Exxon is also involved in ultra-deepwater exploration activities. But it remains to be seen how profitable they are.|Final thoughtsThe signs are ominous. ExxonMobil could break up. Or it may choose to stay the same. But definitely a spinoff of some sort will unlock the hidden value in both the upstream and downstream divisions. Warren Buffett has already seen one such divestiture while holding ConocoPhillips. The question is: Is he sensing something similar to take place at Exxon? The time seems ripe. The integrated model seems to be dying. Long live the integrated model.|As an ExxonMobil retiree (and still a holder of significan XOM stock) I have a definite interest in the questions you pose.|One note: As a working interest partner in the Kashagan project, ExxonMobil was not really in control of the project timeline or the budget. ExxonMobil typically has progressed large projects efficiently and within budget, though, as with any company, there are exceptions.|And yes, the Kashagan project has earned the notoriety of being the most expensive E&P undertaking in the world. However, ExxonMobil seems to be running into unexpected roadblocks and delays in other major projects as well (which might just be a temporary setback).|Why would ExxonMobil become un-integrated and have its profitability suffer from volatile crude oil prices? As noted in the article, ExxonMobil (formerly Standard Oil) was integrated precisely for that reason and has been consistently profitable ever since. The company takes a very long-term view of profitability.|No doubt, Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it's a great value play, which your own analysis suggests, not because he has some foreknowledge that the management is contemplating a spin off.|It is clear that Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it is a great investment but.

Today, two of America's largest retailers, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Target (NYSE: TGT) will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeEstablished in 1978, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is the largest home-improvement specialty retailer in the world. The company is also one of only two retailers on the Dow Jones industrial Average, reflecting its importance to the American economy. Home Depot operates more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico catering to both do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM) styles. Home Depot has been one of the fastest-growing retailers, and also one of the best stocks, since its first store opened in 1979.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Home Depot's paid regular quarterly dividends for more than 20 years since initiating payment in 1992. However, Home Depot's 22-year dividend streak can't hold a candle to Target, whose dividend history dates all the way back to 1967. Target's uninterrupted quarterly dividend-streak of 46 years allows it to win the endurance crown without breaking a sweat.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Home Depot's dividend payouts held firm between 2006 and 2009, which means that it's only been raising its dividend since 2010. By contrast, Target has been raising its dividend payouts since 1968, which equates to a 45-year long dividend-raising streak, according to dividend.com. This one was even more lopsided than the first contest.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Home Depot has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as the U.S. housing market has barely begun to recover from a once-in-a-lifetime crash. Increasing consumer home-improvement spending and strong housing starts have already fueled a double in Home Depot's shares over the past two years. On the other hand, Target has been expanding its geographical presence as well as product offerings, but it's been crimped by an ongoing retail malaise, and a long-running shift toward online retail has barely begun to impact larger brick-and-mortar retailers.

Conversely, even if Obamacare were to somehow fail, insurers such as WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group had incredible pricing power long before this new health reform law was enacted.|Also, with respect to UnitedHealth, which gets about one-quarter of its business from Medicare Advantage -- a supplemental health insurance plan that helps bridge the costs paid out of pocket by Medicare patients -- it would probably see growth in its Medicare Advantage business no matter which scenario ensues.

Today, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) , two companies that have come to symbolize different aspects of the new globalized retail economy, will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeFounded in 1962, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is the world's largest retailer, and ranked as the world's second-largest public corporation on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2013. The company operates more than 11,000 stores under 69 banners in 27 countries, and also maintains e-commerce websites in 10 countries. The Arkansas-based colossus is perhaps more responsible than any other company for changing the way America shops, as its supply chain advancements have helped set the standard for globally-oriented retail operations for decades. However, Wal-Mart has also become a symbol of the purported evils of globalism, as these same supply chain advancements have spurred the growth of sweatshop labor in the developing world while simultaneously crowding smaller local retail enterprises out of many communities.|Founded in 1907, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) is the world's largest package-delivery company by revenue and volume, and is a global supply chain leader, making it an ideal complement to Wal-Mart's retail operations. UPS delivers roughly 1.8 million packages each business day to over 200 countries and territories. and also provides supply chain solutions to customers in over 175 countries and territories. In its last few decades, UPS has expanded enormously through the acquisition of nearly 40 companies, which have included retail shipping services, trucking and air freight, and international trade services.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)Wal-Mart is one of investors' favorite dividend stocks because it's paid uninterrupted dividends for a period of 39 years since initiating payment in 1974. That's an easy win for Wal-Mart over UPS, which only began paying quarterly dividends in 1999, according to Dividata.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak)According to Dividata, UPS has been increasing its dividend at least once per year since 2010, after holding steady in 2009 during the global financial crisis. On the other hand, Wal-Mart has raised its dividend payments every year since 1975, which works out to 38-year dividend-raising streak. This is even more lopsided in Wal-Mart's favor than the first contest.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Wal-Mart may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Wal-Mart has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as its aggressive expansion plans in emerging markets have helped offset domestic weakness. However, the company's once-indomitable supply chain advantage has eroded, and a shift to online retail could ultimately tip UPS into the lead as more consumers decide that they'd rather have their purchases delivered from a nearby warehouse instead of bagged up at a checkout line. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/24/retailers-are-entering-a-cold-war-for-dominance-of.aspx|11/24/2013|On Thursday, Nov. 14, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) announced their hours of operation for Thanksgiving and Black Friday this year. The big-box retailer has announced it will open at 6:00pm on Thanksgiving, two hours earlier than last year, in order to boost consumer traffic and sales revenue. The retailer will remain open throughout the evening and into Black Friday since over 4,000 of their U.S. stores are regularly open 24 hours. In addition, Wal-Mart will offer special deals on must-have items this holiday season through their website beginning Thanksgiving morning. This newest Thanksgiving strategy of offering deals even earlier than usual may seem like a win-win for Wal-Mart, but its competitors are also gearing up for the holiday season. Plus, more time to shop on Thanksgiving does not guarantee that consumers will spend more than their wallets will allow.|It's going to be a nuclear arms raceWal-Mart's actions will not be taken lightly by competitors. Once one retailer makes a bold sales move to draw attention and traffic its way, other retailers must respond in a similar fashion. This move by Walmart to open doors earlier on Thanksgiving, increasing its number of popular items on hand, and starting sales promotions a month earlier on-line will force its competitors to modify their strategy in each of these areas. Wal-Mart's move has started what some may call an "arms race." Retailers are going to closely take note of what the others are doing, mimicking every move by their competitors in order to remain strong on the battlefield. Since the holiday season is six days shorter than last year, retailers are worried that less shopping time for consumers could result in a decrease in sales. Retailers, like Wal-Mart, are pulling out all the stops to not let this holiday season be a letdown.|This means war!Like Wal-Mart, its competitors are also opening doors earlier on Thanksgiving. BestBuy will open its doors at the same time as Wal-Mart in an attempt to lure consumers towards their assortment of electronics. Target, Macy's (NYSE: M) , Kohl's, and J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) will open their doors at 8:00 pm on Thanksgiving. For Macy's and JC Penny, this is their first time being open on Thanksgiving. Macy's and JC Penny had to make this change if they plan on having any sort of sales victory, especially in J.C. Penney's case. Like J.C. Penney, Sears is also hurting sales-wise at both Sears and Kmart. Hoping to recover and make up for lost ground, Sears plans to kick-off Black Friday sales before all the rest by opening all Kmarts' doors at 6:00 am on Thanksgiving. Not only are retailers' opening their doors earlier than in past years, but they also have sales promotions scheduled to run hours, days, and weeks up until Thanksgiving and through the Black Friday weekend.|Sales promotions and hot-ticket items available for consumers have increased this holiday season. Wal-Mart, in fact, has already released its online annual sales promotions, hoping to generate holiday sales a month earlier. In addition, Wal-Mart will have 65% more televisions available to purchase, along with twice as many tablet computers and an additional 17 must-have consumer products on display throughout the store. Wal-Mart will release special deals on these items at different times throughout the evening on Thanksgiving and into Black Friday. Like Wal-Mart, Target is advertising a special daily promotion starting two weeks before Thanksgiving, whereas Best Buy and Kohl's plan to offer online deals for a few days|No retailer is expected to boost revenues by that much this year. For instance, Wal-Mart is expected to increase revenues by 3% year over year, and Best Buy is expected to actually experience a 10.4% decrease in revenues from the same quarter last year. Other retailers like Kohl's, Target, and J.C. Penney are not looking any better than last holiday season, with Kohl's seeing an estimated decrease in revenues of -2.6%, Target by -1.3%, and J.C. Penney increasing revenues by less than half a percent. As far as earnings per share goes, analysts expect Best Buy to increase EPS by $0.11, with the other retailers gaining or losing a negligible $0.02 to $0.04 per share. However, for J.C. Penney, analysts expect the company to lose $0.91 per share, which is better than last fourth quarter when they lost $1.95 per share. For J.C. Penney, this holiday season is their make it or break it quarter.|0|"Wal-Mart"|1

Manitowoc's crane sales improved 10% during the third quarter, while both Caterpillar and Terex, which generate much their revenues outside the U.S., reported weaker results because of a continuing slowdown in overseas markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific and the Latin American regions.|According to a report by Research and Markets projects, the global crane market is expected to grow at a 7.2% per year through 2016, a lucrative opportunity for crane specialist Manitowoc. However, the company has seen crane backlog and new orders fell by 22% and 23%, respectively, which indicates some looming threats to its construction equipment business. Weak macroeconomic conditions and unpleasant investment policies in China have also forced Chinese construction firm Shantui to end its joint venture with Manitowoc. This isn't quite as bad as Caterpillar's woes -- the equipment giant suffered half a billion dollars in losses because of accounting misconducts at ERA Mining Machinery. However, Caterpillar's order backlog, worth $20.4 billion, puts it in a better position than its industry peers.|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|0

Monsanto, DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Syngenta (NYSE: SYT) all provide the one major purchased component that all crop farmers need: seeds with which to grow their crops. Beyond the planting, there is plenty of discrepancy on the other inputs from pesticides to fertilizers, but the seed is the one absolute investment requirement for crop farmers.|Monsanto's contributions came late, but have since spurred a second agricultural revolution. The commercialization of Roundup herbicide in 1976 and the subsequent introduction of Roundup Ready Soybeans twenty years later changed the playing field. Monsanto's Roundup Ready Seeds and the Pioneer Hi-Bred products now owned by DuPont were created in response to farmer demand, with farmers seeking to get the highest yields from their crops. Seeds have since become an absolute consumable, and farmers' dependence on Roundup translated into Monsanto seeds being a no-brain decision.|Why Monsanto is making a climate move Increasing crop productivity is Monsanto's (and DuPont's and Syngenta's) business. Like the productivity-increasing agriculture products of the twentieth century, Monsanto sees the weather-predicting prowess of The Climate Corporation as not only a tool to help increase crop productivity, but also as a business capable of producing substantial annual returns. Monsanto may be taking what looks like a huge $1 billion risk on the acquisition, but the move makes complete sense if one looks closer at what Monsanto has been developing beyond just seeds and pesticides.|Sunny skies ahead Monsanto is mostly alone in taking a direct approach to address the effects of climate conditions on agricultural productivity. Syngenta and DuPont create and are developing products to withstand extreme environments, but Monsanto's investment to provide farmers with tools that may reduce weather-related risks is a direct and forward-looking approach that will pay off for Monsanto.|0|"DuPont"|0

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/23/lowes-got-smashed-was-it-justified.aspx|11/23/2013|After reporting it's most recently completed quarters' earnings, shares of Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) fell more than 6%. The company, which happens to be the second-largest player in home-improvement retail with a market capitalization of $49.8 billion, second only to Home Depot (NYSE: HD) with a market capitalization of $114.2 billion.|After such a tremendous fall, investors should ask themselves if Lowe's is a buy now or if more trouble lies ahead. To answer this question, I delved into its earnings report and compared it to Home Depot.|Lowe's vs. Home DepotThis week, Home Depot also reported earnings. Much to Mr. Market's surprise, the company earned $0.95 per share, 5.6% higher than the $0.90 that analysts expected and substantially higher than the $0.63 it earned last year. The increase in the company's bottom line came about as a result of revenue increasing 7.4% (due to an increase in comparable-store sales of 7.4%) combined with greater cost savings.|For the quarter, Home Depot saw its COGS decline from 65.4% of sales to 65.1%. On top of this improvement, it also experienced a substantial decline in its SG&A expenses, which fell from 22.8% of sales to 21%. Additionally, investors benefited from 81 million fewer shares outstanding, without which earnings per share would have fallen inline with analyst expectations.|Foolish takeawayLooking at the performance of both Lowe's and Home Depot, we can see that neither company appears to be performing poorly. Rather, each entity is growing at a nice pace for their size and they are driving higher returns for shareholders due to cost containment and share buybacks. Furthermore, it would be a misstatement to say that Lowe's reported poor earnings for the quarter.|What the market seems to be doing here is punishing the company unjustifiably, not because it failed to meet earnings but because it did not beat forecasts like its larger rival, Home Depot. As such, this could provide the Foolish investor who believes Lowe's offers a good value proposition an opportunity to buy in at what they may perceive to be a discount.|To bad the market doesn't shop. We have both stores here in town within a quarter mile of each other. Lowe's employees are helpful, cordial, and knowledgeable. Home Depot employees are outwardly disgruntled. The Lowe's store is well stocked with good selections. The Home Depot store has cut item after item from the shelf. Home Depot has moved toward bulk packaging many items pricing themselves out of the DIY/Handyman arena. Wall street, get out and shop.|0|"Home Depot"|0

The stock has been on quite the roller coaster lately. Three weeks ago, the home-improvement retailer found itself on the loser list after dropping 1.96%, but a week later it was the Dow's top performer, gaining 6.2%. The impact of interest rates on the housing market is having an effect, and the stock will probably continue to be volatile in anticipation of even higher rates when the Federal Reserve begins tapering its bond-buying program. We don't know how those changes will affect the housing market, but the company is still positioned to perform well even if housing starts begin to slow.|Fool contributor Matt Thalman owns shares of Home Depot, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase.

Let's take a closer look at these four stocks to figure out why they had such a big impact on the Dow's advance.|Nike only joined the Dow in September, but the stock has risen 24% over the past six months, with a good part of those gains coming in the run-up to Nike's joining the average and its immediate aftermath. For Nike, fundamentals justified the move upward, with fiscal first-quarter results announced in late September showing the athletic apparel giant's rare ability to generate revenue growth in the North American market.

Negative headwinds from Aspartame concerns and the general downtrend in carbonated sodas weighed in on the company. Overall, reported sales increased 1% on the basis of price with overall sales volume declining 1% in the most recent quarter. The five tidbits listed below will help you understand Dr. Pepper Snapple Group's current direction amid towering competition from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) .|Reported top-line growth for the big three beverage companies ranked in the dismal range. Coca-Cola's revenue actually declined 3% in its most recent quarter. Its global sparkling volume expanded a mere 1% versus 3% for non-carbonated beverages. Currency headwinds and restructurings further contributed to Coca-Cola's woes. According to fellow Fool Ted Cooper , Coca-Cola commands more than 40% of the carbonated soda market in North America meaning it still maintains a huge ubiquitous advantage over the other two companies and commands great pricing and distribution power.

In these licensed territories, Coca-Cola Enterprises provides Coca-Cola, Fanta, Capri-Sun, Schweppes, Dr Pepper, Monster, Relentless, and PowerAde. What's interesting about Coca-Cola Enterprises's third-quarter performance is that the volume numbers appear to be moving in the opposite direction from industry trends for sparkling and still beverages, but there's a reason for this.|Recent resultsPrior to going over recent volume performance, it should be noted that the rise of the health-conscious consumer has led to declining demand for sparkling beverages (soda). Also thanks to the rise of the health-conscious consumer, demand for still beverages (juices, ready-to-drink teas, etc.) has increased. However, that wasn't the case for Coca-Cola Enterprises in the third quarter.|In the third quarter, volume increased 2.5% year over year, with sparkling beverage volume popping 4% and still beverage volume sliding 5%. Coca-Cola trademark beverage brand volume jumped 5%, with strong growth in Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero, Cherry Coke Zero, and Vanilla Coke. A lot of this success has to do with Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) status as a marketing juggernaut.|It doesn't seem to matter what headwinds are thrown at Coca-Cola. It will find a way to offset those headwinds. For instance, Coca-Cola's "Share a Coke" program has been a continued success and its international potential is still in its infant stages. If you would like an example of the "Share a Coke" program, you can watch this short video: http://youtu.be/5l0cCyElfgg|Even the CIA is helping Coca-Cola. No ... undercover spies aren't tapping into phones and watching potential customers with night-vision goggles. This is a different CIA -- the Culinary Institute of America. Researchers at this CIA help determine what meals best complement Coca-Cola. This information is then passed on to certain quick-service and full-service restaurants. The idea here is to enhance the customer experience for these restaurants. While many consumers have a beverage of choice, others will select a drink based on their mood. This program can help lead customers in the right direction in order to maximize their meal experience.|Still beverages should bounce back, and Coca-Cola has proven that it has the capability to drive demand for sparkling beverages with its marketing power. This is a positive for Coca-Cola Enterprises. There is also good potential in emerging markets as these consumers aren't as health-conscious as Americans. At least not yet.|While Coca-Cola Enterprises is a quality operation, it lags PepsiCo on the top line, it comes up short of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo at turning revenue into profit, and its yield isn't quite as impressive as Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.|When you compare Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, as always, it seems like somewhat of a wash. While PepsiCo is performing better on the top line, Coca-Cola is more impressive in profit margin, yield, and debt-to-equity ratio. However, debt isn't really a concern for any of these companies, since they generate so much cash. In other words, they're capable of paying down those debts.|Coca-Cola might be a marketing juggernaut, but if you're looking for resiliency then PepsiCo might be a slightly better option thanks to its broad product diversification.|Coca-Cola makes this list, but so do two other companiesIf you're looking for some long-term investing ideas, you're invited to check out The Motley Fool's brand-new special report, "The 3 Dow Stocks Dividend Investors Need."

However, Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives twice quelled analysts' concern about Britvic's possible gain in market share by saying Coca-Cola Enterprises gained year-to-date volume and value share in Europe.|Marketing and weather gave the company a boostThe vast majority of volume growth came from brand Coca-Cola. Regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero increased volume 4% and 23% respectively. Other Coca-Cola flavors, a category that include Vanilla Coke and Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, increased volume 10%. Marketing campaigns such as the "Share-a-Coke" program where people can purchase a can of Coke with their name as well as the "Coke with Meals" program where Coca-Cola products gets marketed with food, in addition to temporarily favorable weather conditions in the month of July contributed greatly to the volume increases.|European economy remains poorDespite an improving GDP, Coca-Cola Enterprises faces tough macroeconomic headwinds in the form of continued high unemployment and a cash strapped consumer that wants to sit on their wallet. The ravages of the various sovereign debt crises and a steep recession still remain on the minds of the European populace. Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives expect growth to remain low to flat in the near term and the weather conditions and the effects from its marketing campaign that caused the uptick in volume and revenue experienced in the most recent quarter will not remain.|Still beverages faced tough comparisonsInterestingly, Coca-Cola Enterprises' still beverages actually performed worse than sparkling with volume declining 5%. This stems from difficult comparisons to the same time last year when still beverages grew in the double digits probably due to the Olympics in London. Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives downplayed its weakness in bottled water saying that it only comprised 3% of sales.|Diets not a problemWhile diet soda volume and sales continue to suffer here in the United States due to aspartame fears Coca-Cola Enterprises reports no such declines at least not yet. Coca-Cola Enterprises' CFO Hubert Patricot said that diet sodas "continue to grow very fast" and "outperformed the regular portfolio" in the most recent quarter.|Foolish takeawayCoca-Cola Enterprises trades at 19 times earnings right on par with the S&P 500 and a little less than Coca-Cola's P/E of 21. Regardless of the negative sentiment by Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives and the market in general, evidence points to pockets of recovery in Europe. Eventually European unemployment will begin to trend downward resulting in increased consumer spending. If this happens Coca-Cola Enterprises' revenue and free cash flow will accelerate translating into capital gains and dividend increases. Currently Coca-Cola Enterprises yields $0.80 per share yielding 1.9%. Coca-Cola Enterprises may represent a long-term turnaround play.|0|"Coca-Cola"|3

As a testament to the enormity of what the company has become, I decided that now might be a good time for the Foolish investor to learn some interesting details about the world's largest soft drink provider.|Coca-Cola serves... a lot!As a large company, it's not hard to imagine that Coca-Cola sells a lot of products every year. However, you might be surprised about how much. According to research, Coca-Cola serves 1.7 billion servings (inclusive of all of its 500 brands across at least 200 countries) every day. Stacked up against the roughly 50 billion servings of beverages globally, this comprises 3.4% of all servings drank.|In response to this lack of support, John Austin, Coke's Chairman and CEO at the time, met with the mayor of the city and top businessmen. In a frank manner, he said, "It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located in a city that refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Co. does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Co." Following this short speech, tickets for the event sold out in only two hours, which suggests that maybe we should use the head of Coca-Cola more often for political controversies today.|In 2006, three individuals (one of whom was an employee at Coca-Cola) were arrested on charges of stealing and attempting to sell trade secrets. According to one news source, the defendants contacted PepsiCo and offered to sell it documents, as well as a vial of an experimental Coca-Cola drink, for $1.5 million. Instead of taking them up on the offer, PepsiCo notified a Coca-Cola employee of the breach who, in turn, brought in the FBI for a sting operation.|The world of Coca-ColaApparently, it wasn't enough for Coca-Cola to take over the beverage industry, because it has now jumped into the world of tourism. In Atlanta there exists the World of Coca-Cola, a museum and exhibition about the company. Included in the exhibit is a variety of original artwork from professional painters like Norman Rockwell, and a vault experience that talks about the company's secret formula.|On top of these experiences, the World of Coca-Cola includes a 42-foot high bottle from Sky Field made of more than 11,000 pieces of authentic Atlanta Braves equipment. Finally, the location has a large fountain machine called Coca-Cola Freestyle that allows visitors to try more than 100 different drink combinations.
