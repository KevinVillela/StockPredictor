That's the best annual performance for the Dow in 18 years, and financial stocks have played a vital role both in today's gains and in the longer-run results for the stock market since the current bull market began in 2009. American Express (NYSE: AXP) was the best performer in the Dow today, but Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) , JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) , and Visa (NYSE: V) have all done their part in lifting the average in 2013.|Essentially, the gains in the financials reflect improvement in just about every major facet of American financial life. Three of the four financials have benefited from favorable conditions in the credit- and debit-card industry. JPMorgan's Chase unit is one of the biggest issuers of credit cards and has benefited from improving economic conditions that have led to reduced delinquency and charge-off rates. Even with its traditional focus toward upper-income customers for whom financial worries are usually secondary, American Express has also benefited greatly this year from improving economic conditions both in the U.S. and abroad. For Visa, its invitation to join the Dow emphasized the value of its card network, as it provides a leading platform for electronic transactions without having the systemic risk of relying on cardholders' creditworthiness to produce profits.|Looking forward to 2014, the Dow will rely on Visa, American Express, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs to pull their weight if investors want to see a sixth year of bull-market gains. For now, financials appear to be on solid footing, with signs pointing to a healthy economic expansion that could continue well into the coming year and beyond.

Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) among the Dow's few stragglers, with the health care giant ending 2013 with a day in the red. Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Americans find their confidenceAmerican Express' stock has jumped 1% today. The credit card giant received a boost early on when the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped for December. American consumer confidence rose to its highest rating in three months following declines in both October and November, with consumers' future expectations in particular receiving a boost.|That's offering up rosy speculation about consumer spending in the new year, something American Express and its investors would welcome wholeheartedly. The economic recovery pushed this stock to among the best on the Dow Jones in recent years -- in 2013 alone, American Express ranked only behind Boeing on the Dow's board, gaining more than 57% year to date.|The surge of business has added up quickly for American Express as consumers have regained their footing. The company's U.S. card-based business climbed 8% year over year through the first nine months of 2013, with total American Express cards in force in America jumping 4% during that time and average card member spending climbing 5%. If consumer confidence continues to gain ground early in 2014, look for American Express' financials to follow it higher.|Fool contributor Dan Carroll has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"Wireless enables home automation capability," says AT&T's Randall Stephenson during the UBS Global Media and Communication Conference on Dec. 10. "Home security, home automation, home monitoring.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/31/flashing-red-the-dows-3-most-expensive-stocks.aspx|12/31/2013|0|"Boeing"|1|The stock market has had a banner year -- its best since 1997. As of Monday's close, the Dow is up 25.9%. (The return is 29.1% once you account for dividends.) Naturally, that rise has been accompanied by increasingly frequent warnings that stocks have become overpriced. Below I take a brief look at that charge with regard to the Dow's three most expensive stocks (on the basis of price-to-forward earnings multiples): Visa (NYSE: V) , Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Boeing (NYSE: BA) .|All three stocks (particularly Boeing) have easily beaten the S&P 500 and the Dow in a roaring bull market. That feat may raise suspicions that investor exuberance is the culprit, but it is not simply the product of investors willing to pay a higher multiple to own these shares. In the case of Visa and Boeing, multiple expansion accounts for less than 40% of this year's rise in the stock price; the rest is due to increases in earnings (estimates). In the case of Nike, however, the increase in the multiple explains two-thirds of this year's return.|Bottom line: None of these stocks look particularly attractive right now, but if I had to rank them in descending order of attractiveness, it would be Visa first, then Boeing, and finally Nike. Visa's wide moat, capital-light business model, and growth prospects are worth the highest multiple -- certainly higher than Nike. Meanwhile, Boeing is the better of two companies operating a duopoly. If you own any of these three stocks, there is no cause for panic, particularly if you are (as I recommend) a long-term investor. But don't go thinking you will earn the same returns in 2014 that you earned this year, because that simply isn't going to happen.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/31/why-did-caterpillar-fall-far-behind-a-surging-dow.aspx|12/31/2013|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|0|Why Did Caterpillar Fall Far Behind a Surging Dow in 2013?|Like many of its industrial peers, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) was hit hard by the financial crisis, but the post-crash market rebound initially seemed to provide a powerful tailwind in the heavy-equipment maker's sails (and sales). Within two years of the end of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES: ^DJI) slide, Caterpillar's stock had surged to a 400% gain -- but this would be a high-water mark for shareholders, who have endured a flat 2013 even as the index and many of its other large-cap components have raced to once-in-a-decade gains:|Why did Caterpillar peter out in 2013? One easy way to find out is to see how its fundamentals have progressed between last year and this one. On that account, Caterpillar has certainly given investors little reason to keep the faith, as nearly every important metric has declined significantly:|While free cash flow certainly looks to have risen impressively over last year's result, we should keep in mind that this was affected by one major change: inventory writedowns (this year is the first since 2009 in which Caterpillar recorded positive inventory totals on its cash flow statement) produced a nearly $5 billion swing over 2012. Caterpillar also boosted its capital expenditure by more than $1 billion from 2011 to 2012 even as operating cash flow declined, and it hasn't boosted that spending again this year.|Caterpillar's forward guidance hasn't given investors much cause for celebration, either, and Wall Street now expects the company to underperform all of its major heavy-machinery peers except for Deere (NYSE: DE) , which is slated to lose ground in 2014. Our Foolish analysts have dug deep into Caterpillar's doldrums to figure out why 2013 has been so problematic and whether the company is still worth a spot in portfolios today. Most of the analysis comes to the same conclusion: Caterpillar isn't out of the woods yet.|If you weren't sure that Caterpillar's misfortune is heavily tied to mining, or if you think that that mining weaknesses are sure to be short-lived, then there's one graph that should change your mind:|Caterpillar is about more than just mining, of course, but in 2013 it was kept afloat entirely by valuation growth -- its P/E has increased 65% this year, from just under 11 at the start of the year to a P/E of more than 17 today. That's significantly more valuation growth than that experienced by either Joy Global (30% higher) or Deere (a 12% decline during the year), and at the moment Caterpillar's P/E is far higher than that of either competitors (Joy Global's is just under 12 and Deere's is 10). That speaks to greater investor faith, but it could easily point to another weak year ahead -- there's only so much buying investors will do before they decide to wait for a rebound in fundamentals.

They dominate oil and natural gas production, refining, and marketing or distribution, and are some of the biggest companies in the world.|Hitting Big Oil where it hurtsThe trends I've outlined above have already hurt the performance of Big Oil.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/31/will-big-oils-energy-efficiency-initiatives-pay-of.aspx|12/31/2013|0|"Chevron"|0|It goes without saying that members of Big Oil including Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are the world's premier producers of oil and natural gas, the two resources that will remain the primary sources of energy for years to come. At the same time, many oil companies readily admit the importance of energy efficiency, particularly when it comes to serving the energy needs of rapidly developing economies. Across the globe, emerging economies are devouring energy at an alarming rate, which compels certain majors like Chevron and others to take efficiency seriously.|More efficient energy companies coming soonChevron understands that the most cost-effective energy solutions will come directly from energy efficiency and conservation. That's why it launched a subsidiary known as Chevron Energy Solutions Co. to pilot the company's efforts toward reducing emissions, and has been extremely effective in upgrading facilities and incorporating renewables into the broader business.|For example, in recent years Chevron has supplemented its growth in Indonesia and the Philippines with geothermal energy. Chevron now prides itself on being one of the world's leading geothermal producers, and currently supplies 890 megawatts of electricity capacity in Indonesia and the Philippines, which is enough to serve millions of customers.|Not to be outdone, Chevron's biggest rival, integrated behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , is determined not to fall behind in this regard. Since 2000, ExxonMobil's Global Energy Management System has allowed the company to pinpoint and effectively act on several energy-saving initiatives specifically in its downstream and chemicals businesses. On the upstream side of the business, ExxonMobil launched a program called the Production Operations Energy Management System. These efforts have combined to effectively limit the company's operational energy usage, which was flat in 2012 versus 2011.|Why this mattersIt may be tempting to dismiss Big Oil's energy efficiency programs. After all, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP still reap the vast majority of its profits from traditional oil and gas exploration and production. However, that would be short-sighted. Growth going forward is in the emerging markets, where success hinges largely on providing large amounts of cost-effective energy.|To summarize, while it's unlikely investors will see the benefits of their initiatives show up on the income statement, the long-term advantages will surely be felt. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP are quickly becoming much more energy-efficient companies than investors are accustomed to. Expansion into the emerging markets will be helped a great deal by increased efficiencies. Not only do these initiatives make for good public relations, they stand to meaningfully improve economics as well for members of Big Oil. Since future growth in developed nations like the United States will be far out-weighed by growth in the emerging economies, success in the emerging markets will result in sustained growth for many years.

With the promise of providing a natural-gas fueling infrastructure for the trucking industries in the U.S., Clean Energy Fuels seemed to be driving the way for the transportation sector to take advantage of the huge rise in production of low-cost natural gas from unconventional sources like shale plays. Yet despite the fact that Westport Innovations (NASDAQ: WPRT) and other companies were working on natural-gas fueled engines for trucks, and despite the company receiving assistance from General Electric (NYSE: GE) , investors remain unconvinced that Clean Energy Fuels will be a long-term moneymaker.

The health care products giant's consecutive dividend streak started back in 1977, and the current dividend is $2.82. The recent dividend increase will keep that streak going in 2014, giving the stock a yield of 3.05%. That is the 12th-highest yield on the Dow and above the index's 2.7% average.|Let's take a look at how Johnson & Johnson got here and then figure out whether this dividend is sustainable and can continue to be increased in the future.|The pastJohnson & Johnson has increased its dividend for 50 years, starting in 1963. The chart below shows the dividend's steady rise since 1985.|Many investors consider Johnson & Johnson to be one of the most stable companies within the market; and as you can easily see in the chart above, the dividend growth is like clockwork. But how has the share price performed over the same time frame? Let's see.|While there have been a few minor hiccups throughout the years, the stock has risen slowly but steadily. If you had been wise enough to purchase shares of Johnson & Johnson 28 years ago, your investment would have given you an annualized return of 12.6%. But if you had taken that one step further and reinvested the increasing dividend for the past 28 years, your return would have jumped from 2,710% to 5,059%, or an annualized return of 15.1%.|Johnson & Johnson has certainly been good to long-term shareholders in the past, but will the future be as bright?|The futureAnalysts' expectations for the company aren't great at this time. Estimates for earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 are only $0.01 higher than what Johnson & Johnson reported for the last quarter of 2012. First-quarter 2014 EPS is only expected to be 2.7% higher than in 2013, while revenue growth that quarter is supposed to jump 3.4%.|These figures may not seem remarkable, but when they are put into the context of a company the size of Johnson & Johnson, with a market cap of $260 billion, even what seems like a small amount of growth is really huge.

Visa's franchise is even better entrenched, drawing on two types of competitive advantage: a global brand and the world's largest retail electronics network. These are the type of businesses that can support a premium valuation -- and make no mistake about it, these stocks do trade at a premium to the market (the S&P 500 is currently valued at roughly 16 times forward earnings). The question is, what is a fair premium?|All three stocks (particularly Boeing) have easily beaten the S&P 500 and the Dow in a roaring bull market. That feat may raise suspicions that investor exuberance is the culprit, but it is not simply the product of investors willing to pay a higher multiple to own these shares. In the case of Visa and Boeing, multiple expansion accounts for less than 40% of this year's rise in the stock price; the rest is due to increases in earnings (estimates). In the case of Nike, however, the increase in the multiple explains two-thirds of this year's return.|Bottom line: None of these stocks look particularly attractive right now, but if I had to rank them in descending order of attractiveness, it would be Visa first, then Boeing, and finally Nike. Visa's wide moat, capital-light business model, and growth prospects are worth the highest multiple -- certainly higher than Nike. Meanwhile, Boeing is the better of two companies operating a duopoly. If you own any of these three stocks, there is no cause for panic, particularly if you are (as I recommend) a long-term investor. But don't go thinking you will earn the same returns in 2014 that you earned this year, because that simply isn't going to happen.

(NYSE: VFC) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) have both had great years in 2013; Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL) has lagged its peers but still saw impressive growth. These are three competitors that are very similar, but which is the cheapest and is offering investors the best investment opportunity?|Three similar companiesNike, of course, sells branded shoes and activewear, while Ralph Lauren is a maker of designer clothes. On the other hand, VF operates an assortment of brands, including Timberland and Vans shoes and The North Face, Wrangler, and Nautica clothes.|Nike|In the last few years, Nike has seen the greatest growth, and thus is awarded with a greater multiple versus its peers. So now that we have this information, let's look at expected top-line growth rates for both this full year and 2014.|Nike|For the most part, the market has correctly valued the three companies in question. Clearly, Nike is head and shoulders above its peers in terms of growth (and valuation). But with VF and Ralph Lauren, there is an apparent disconnect in growth and valuation.|Ralph Lauren vs. NikeAlthough Nike is operating on a higher level, we can still apply the same formula to determine its value relative to Ralph Lauren and then to determine which is the cheaper of it and VF.|For example, Nike is growing 31% faster than Ralph Lauren over a two-year period. Yet using Nike's forward P/E and price-to-sales ratios, it trades at a premium of just 27.5% and 17%, respectively, versus Ralph Lauren.|Therefore, Nike is actually presenting more value than Ralph Lauren despite the appearance of being more expensive. Moreover, since Ralph Lauren presents more value than VF, this means that Nike is presenting both the most upside and value among its two peers.|Final thoughtsAt first glance, you wouldn't think that Nike would be the cheapest of these three companies. However, this misconception is only due to the fact that most retail investors use only P/E or price-to-sales ratios and don't incorporate growth into the equation.
http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/31/technology/nike-fuelband-review/|12/31/2013|0|"Nike"|0|The Fuelband is a simple, rubberized black band that you wear around your wrist. It records your movements and tells you how active you are (or aren't) by displaying your "Nikefuel" number. Nike(NKE, Fortune 500) won't say how it calculates the Nikefuel number, but the higher it is, the more active you've been during the day.|You can set a daily Nikefuel goal -- say, 2500 -- and see how close you're getting to that number throughout the day.|The iPhone app (Nike doesn't support Android) is decent but not groundbreaking. It shows you your daily Nikefuel number, along with weekly and monthly reports of your activity. It will give you awards for meeting certain milestones or challenges. And it will even do some basic analysis, such as telling you what your most active days of the week are, or how much Nikefuel you earn on an average day or week. But much of that data feels superficial.|The real killer Fuelband feature isn't about hardware or software; it's psychological. There's a little meter under your Nikefuel score egging you on to meet your goal. If you are meeting your daily goal with ease, the app will challenge you to raise it. And there's a social component, which lets you compare scores and awards with friends and even challenge each other to be more active.|However, the Fuelband does have some room for improvement. Every so often, the Fuelband fails to connect with its iPhone app via Bluetooth. The problem always resolves itself, but that sometimes takes hours, which is annoying. Nike's sleep tracking feature is also a disappointment, requiring you to manually start a session. It's a battery suck, and all you get in return is a glorified diary of how long you're sleeping on average.|Fuelband isn't for everyone. If you're interested in tracking performance-based stats like heart rate or mile times, a full-fledged sports watch is probably the better purchase. If you're still undecided (and have an iPhone 5S), try out the free Nike Move app. It's significantly more limited in function than the Fuelband, but it offers a taste of what an activity tracker can do.

Sales of Pfizer and Bristol's Eliquis have been far more disappointing, totaling just $12 million in the second quarter. That disappointment prompted a big marketing push which drove Eliquis sales up to $44 million in the third quarter. While the two companies are likely happy to see sales rebound, Eliquis small market share has got to be frustrating given Eliquis is the only one of the new generation of anti-coagulants to show improved mortality in trials.|Pfizer and Bristol's third quarter sales pop has gotten J&J and Bayer's attention. The two companies are responding with their own direct-to-consumer ad campaign in a bid to offset Eliquis threat and win Pradaxa share. U.S. sales of Xarelto jumped to $270 million in the third quarter from $215 million in the second quarter.|Fool-worthy final thoughtsBoehringer and the well-heeled Pfizer and Bristol aren't going to go away quietly.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/31/top-3 -retailers-for-customer-retention-in-2013.aspx|12/31/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|2|Top performerThe top performer doesn't come as a surprise. It's a retailer that I have been bullish on for years, despite so many people hating the company. Therefore, if you read this column, then you already know it's Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) .|According to the survey, Wal-Mart has retained 88.2% of the customers that it acquired late last year. This is an incredible number. There are several reasons for this.|One, while many people shop online and use Amazon.com, more people still prefer to visit a brick-and-mortar store. Since Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world while also offering everyday low prices, the impressive retention number is logical. Other potential catalysts include a lenient return policy (no receipt necessary in many cases), extremely broad product diversification, and an impressive food section including quality and often underrated produce.|The reason for concern, for all three dollar stores, is that Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express are expanding, partially in an effort to steal back market share from the dollar stores. Wal-Mart is the clear favorite given its deep pockets and marketing power. However, dollar-store shoppers are very loyal to their brands, and it will be difficult for Wal-Mart to pry them away. It should be an interesting competition. As of right now, Dollar Tree is a clear winner, but keep an eye on Wal-Mart's advancement into Dollar Tree territory.|The takeawayTry not to let the survey's results scare you off Costco. Just keep an eye on the company's results if you're already involved. Barnes & Noble's long-term potential appears to be poor, as is Target's near-term potential. Dollar Tree continues to grow, but competition is likely to increase. In my opinion, if you're looking for a long-term investment where you're likely to see slow and steady growth while receiving steady dividend payments, then Wal-Mart should be considered.

Target is the third-largest retailer in the U.S., and is soon to be fourthOne of the most-commonly misunderstood things about Target is that it is the third largest U.S. retailer, not second. When you think of the two biggest U.S. retailers you usually think of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as no. 1 and then Target as no. 2, but you would be wrong. Based on 2012 annual sales, the ranking goes: Wal-Mart ($328 billion), Kroger (NYSE: KR) ($92 billion), and then Target ($72 billion.)|3. Target and Wal-Mart opened their first stores in the same yearIt may be hard to believe, but two of the largest retailers in the world both opened their doors to business in 1962.|On May 1, the first ever Target store was opened in Roseville, Minnesota. Two months later, on July 2, the first ever Wal-Mart was opened in Rogers, Arkansas.|51 years and billions of customers later, Target and Wal-Mart are both still hanging in there. In 2012, the two combined to generate more than half a trillion dollars in revenue (Wal-Mart: $469 billion, Target: $72 billion).|4. Target has grown its dividend twice times as fast as Wal-Mart over the past decadeWal-Mart is often credited as having one of the most-reliable, fastest-growing dividends in the entire stock market. While I don't want to downplay Wal-Mart's fantastic accomplishment, Target has been putting Wal-Mart to shame over the past decade. Over this time period, Target has grown its dividend 514.3%, which is nearly double Wal-Mart's 261.5% growth.|5. Target is a Twitter expertTarget has over a million followers on Twitter: 1,012,944 followers as of last count. To put that into perspective, that is more than double the 437,709 followers Wal-Mart has, more than 21 times the 48,002 followers Kroger has, and more than 50 times the 19,930 followers Costco has.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/31/is-wal-mart-finally-on-the-right-track.aspx|12/31/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|0|Is Wal-Mart Finally on the Right Track?|The U.S. retail industry has been exposed to an economic slowdown and low consumer confidence. Under these trying circumstances, retail giants like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , Target (NYSE: TGT) , and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) have struggled one way or the other. For instance, Wal-Mart recently missed Wall Street's revenue estimates by almost 1%. Does this mean that Wal-Mart's future looks bleak? Let's see what the company is doing to rekindle its growth.|What is Wal-Mart up to?During the last year, Wal-Mart was able to generate $7.7 billion in revenue through the e-commerce sector. This amount, however, was very nominal as compared to Amazon.com's e-commerce revenue of $61 billion. Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke recently highlighted the fact that the company should have invested more in its e-commerce segment last year so that it could have capitalized more on the growing e-commerce market.|For this reason, the company is now investing heavily in hiring IT professionals and making improvements in its search engine and mobile apps. As a result, Wal-Mart is expecting its e-commerce sales to reach $10 billion by year-end. As the e-commerce industry has become one of the biggest growth drivers for U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart will continue to expand its online business, thus generating more revenue in the future.|Since the start of this year, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sector has grown by 30%. To grow it even further, Wal-Mart is focusing on the Chinese e-commerce market, which is expected to yield composite annual growth of 32% from 2012 to 2015. Therefore, Wal-Mart has a goal of opening more than 110 facilities in China by the end of 2016. This will make sure that the company is on the right track to grow its e-commerce segment in the world's most populous country, which in turn will help Wal-Mart to catch up with Amazon's market share in China|Apart from increasing its stores in China, Wal-Mart is also shutting down stores that aren't generating a lot of revenue. Under this rationalization process, the company will close up to 50 stores in China and Brazil within the next few months. This move comes as part of Wal-Mart's strategy of decreasing its overall operating costs.|In the U.S. market, Wal-Mart's small-format stores are doing slightly better than its large Supercenters. Same-store sales for these small-format stores rose 3.4% in the most recent quarter. To enhance its income even further, Wal-Mart has plans to expand its small stores to more than 400 by the end of this year.|FundamentalsWal-Mart has a high return on equity of 23.3%, which is proof that the company is generating healthy profits for its shareholders. Its inventory turnover ratio signifies that it's managing its resources better than Target, but it lags Costco. As Wal-Mart has revised its earnings estimates for the year from a range of $5.10-$5.30 to $5.01-$5.10, its share price has dipped, indicating in slightly lower confidence among investors. This has resulted in a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.8.|Wal-Mart's other competitor, Costco, also missed its revenue estimates in the latest quarter by 1.1%. However, revenue jumped 6% from the comparable quarter of the previous year to $25 billion. Revenue from membership fees grew 7% to $549 million, while same-store sales climbed by 3%.|Final thoughtsThe e-commerce industry is getting more popular day by day as more customers shop online. Wal-Mart has been in the retail industry for quite some time but its main focus has always remained on physical stores. However, this year Wal-Mart has invested in its e-commerce segment, which is certainly going to pay off in the coming years. The company's strategy of closing down low-revenue stores will make sure it keeps its operating costs at bay.|Furthermore, opening facilities in China will give its e-commerce business a much needed boost. But, because the company has revised its earnings estimates for the year, it won't be able to do that well in the near future. The investment in e-commerce needs at least a year before it starts to bear fruits for the company. Considering all of this, Wal-Mart looks to be a better investment for the long run than for the short run.
http://www.thestreet.com/story/12189248/1/interesting-january-2015-stock-options-for-axp.html|12/30/2013|0|"American Express"|3|Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is American Express (AXP). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for AXP. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.64. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.4% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 2.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to AXP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless American Express Co. sees its shares decline 24.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $65.86 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.64 from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.3% annualized rate of return.|Worth considering, is that the annualized 2.3% figure actually exceeds the 1% annualized dividend paid by American Express Co. by 1.3%, based on the current share price of $89.28. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 24.4% to reach the $67.50 strike price.

The program has been rolled out to 7,000 cabs in New York and VeriFone is quite optimistic about the potential going forward.|This is a good development for both American Express and VeriFone. American Express has brought a groundbreaking feature for its cardholders through this move. Earlier, AmEx cardholders could only use reward points to make online purchases, but now they can spend in the physical world as well. This is where VeriFone's presence across various establishments would come into play and help AmEx attract more customers. Encouraged by this move, VeriFone is now looking to take this program international.|VeriFone also seems to be getting more business from different companies around the world. In the U.S., Sephora, American Girl, VF Corp, and Under Armour have adopted VeriFone's mobile solutions.

There are countless questions regarding this issue, but for the sake of brevity, this article will focus on demand trends coming from Tier 1 service providers like AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and touch on prospects from emerging markets. The type of solutions being bought by AT&T and Verizon will dictate selling opportunities for companies like Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) as well as many others in the telco space.|AT&T and VerizonThe issue facing service providers in the developed world is that average revenue per user is falling because technological advancements have reduced the importance of fixed and mobile voice usage. As a consequence, carriers like AT&T and Verizon are trying to reduce capital expenditures as a share of revenue, even while revenue growth is slowing. Verizon's capital expenditure of $16.1 billion in 2012 is approximately $930 million less than it spent in 2006. Conversely, AT&T's have been rising, but this is largely due to the roll out of its 4G/LTE network later than Verizon.|In addition, both companies have given lackluster capital spending forecasts. AT&T's management stated, "we would expect the CapEx for this year to be in $21 billion range and for '14 and '15 to be in the $20 billion range."These figures are below what AT&T has spent in previous years. Meanwhile, Verizon argued that "As far as CapEx goes, I have been pretty consistent here. You should consider us improving our CapEx-to-revenue ratio going forward."|Smartphone penetration driving growth However, the reality is that service providers will still have to invest, just in different ways. The trend carrying over from 2013 is that Verizon and AT&T have been surprised by the strength in the increase of smartphone penetration, while seeing disappointments at the lower end. On AT&T's recent conference call, management outlined:|The bottom lineIt's hard to get too excited by overall North American spending because AT&T and Verizon have made it clear that they are not planning a major ramp up in spending. However, the type of spending taking place means there will be winners and losers in the process. As for emerging markets, much will depend on the macro-economic climate. However, with most forecasters predicting stronger economic growth this year, it's reasonable to expect a better year overall. But, the investment focus should still be on niche players like Ciena, rather than larger all-purpose telco suppliers.

The reason given was that it would hurt the competitive landscape, affect pricing, and cause job losses.|Combined, AT&T and T-Mobile would have created more than 150 million subscribers, which is far more than Verizon's 107 million. Moreover, and most importantly, it would have reduced the number of nationwide carriers from four to three, hence affecting free market.|If Sprint was to acquire T-Mobile, the combined number of total subscribers would be under 100 million, far fewer than either Verizon or AT&T. Furthermore, regarding post-paid subscribers only, Sprint/T-Mobile would have just 53 million, versus 95 million for Verizon and 72 million for AT&T.|Yet, despite the fact that Sprint and T-Mobile combined would be smaller in size, it would still lower the number of nationwide providers from four to three, which was a primary issue for the FCC when it rejected AT&T's offer.|A breakup could be a hold upAT&T unwisely offered, and then had to pay, T-Mobile $7 billion as a breakup fee when its acquisition attempt was blocked by the FCC.|At the time, the proposed fee was considered a sign of good faith and confidence on behalf of AT&T. Breakup fees with companies of this size are commonplace, but this hasn't been discussed openly as it relates to Sprint's offer.|SoftBank CEO, Masayoshi Son, will try to avoid a $7 billion breakup fee, especially considering what happened with AT&T. However, Sprint and Deutsche will have to agree on a fair price, possibly $3 billion-$5 billion. If the acquisition is blocked by the FCC, either for competitive reasons or because the FCC simply doesn't want a Japanese company controlling such a large U.S. telecom company, then Sprint will have to pay out the cash.|Priced for perfectionLastly, to determine upside based on valuation relative to its peers, take a look at a few key metrics of Sprint compared to AT&T and Verizon:|AT&T|With Sprint being unprofitable and disconnected from its peers in every fundamental metric possible, the only way to compare the three with a single metric is with price/sales. Currently, Sprint trades with a very similar multiple to Verizon, while AT&T has a 30% premium.|Yet, Verizon and AT&T are light years ahead of Sprint, with their profitability, balance sheet strength, margins, growth, and dividends. Sprint should trade at a massive discount to its peers, not a comparable multiple. Therefore, this in itself presents a risk, as Sprint is essentially overvalued, or priced with peers that are far better companies.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for CVX. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $80 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 75 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.9% return against the $80 commitment, or a 0.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to CVX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Chevron Corporation sees its shares fall 35.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.25 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 75 cents from $80), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 0.9% annualized rate of return.|Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2015 expiration, for shareholders of Chevron Corporation (CVX) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $135 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.88 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost), for a total of 5.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $135 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CVX shares would have to advance 8.6% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.|The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Chevron Corporation, highlighting in green where the $80 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $135 strike in red:

You can see some of the crosscurrents in the Dow's performance today, with an overall gain of 26 points hiding some tension beneath the surface among two important sectors of the market. Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) were among those stocks that climbed the most today, while ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) were both on the losing side.|Energy, though, presents a greater conundrum for investors, as Exxon dropped 1.2% and Chevron declined 0.8% today. On one hand, an economic recovery should boost energy use, creating demand that should support prices and help Exxon and Chevron boost their overall profits. Yet on the supply side, smaller producers are clamoring to restart projects that they suspended when natural gas prices were much lower, and the resulting increase in available oil and natural gas could present problems for the energy giants. Moreover, as the revolutionary recovery strategies pioneered in the U.S. spread abroad more extensively, they could boost supply even further -- solving the problem of sustaining production levels but only at the cost of price drops. Exxon and Chevron will have to search out ways to diversify their holdings in order to benefit from changing trends in energy in the long run.|The right way to play energyEven if Exxon and Chevron don't profit the most from record oil and natural gas production doesn't mean you can't find winning stocks in energy. The Motley Fool is offering a comprehensive look at three energy companies set to soar during this transformation in the energy industry.

While it may, some context is helpful. ExxonMobil's valuation may not be as cheap as it appears, given that close rival Chevron (NYSE: CVX) exchanges hands for 10 times trailing earnings.|What ExxonMobil needs for its rally to continueExxonMobil clearly needs refining to reverse its decline in order for its momentum to keep going. While industry profitability is suffering for the integrated majors, Chevron has held up much better. ExxonMobil's quarterly profit fell 18%, primarily because it leans on refining to a larger extent than Chevron. ExxonMobil's earnings per share are down 27% through the first three quarters, as opposed to the same period last year.|In all, Chevron earnings are down 13% through the first nine months, and while it's understandable to be disappointed by falling earnings, it's still an entirely manageable decline. Chevron continues to tread water much better than ExxonMobil, thanks to very strong upstream results that are helping to offset its poor refining business. Furthermore, project ramp-ups in the United States, Nigeria, and Angola will serve as a catalyst for further growth in the company's upstream segment.|Meanwhile, Chevron's underlying profitability has held up much better over the first three quarters of the year, and offers investors a lower valuation, and a better dividend as a result. While it's easy to get excited over the prospect of ExxonMobil finally breaking out, Chevron seems like a better bet going forward.

According to Energy Information Administration data, crude inventories have dropped by 23.8 million barrels over just the past month. When you couple that drop with higher energy usage due a cold winter you get the perfect recipe to bring Chevron out of its recent slump. While Chevron's refining profits may lag, a WTI price above $100 per barrel is great news for shareholders and its exploration and production profits.|The Motley Fool owns shares of, and recommends Ford, Intel, MasterCard, and Waste Management.

There are countless questions regarding this issue, but for the sake of brevity, this article will focus on demand trends coming from Tier 1 service providers like AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and touch on prospects from emerging markets. The type of solutions being bought by AT&T and Verizon will dictate selling opportunities for companies like Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) as well as many others in the telco space.|These trends are likely to make carriers in the developed world focus on purchasing higher-end networking solutions, rather than investing in maintaining older networks. This might hurt a company like Cisco, but it will benefit Ciena with its next-generation technology. Ciena is particularly strong in 40G and 100G ethernet networking and optical transport networks. As for Cisco, service providers make up around 31% of its revenue. They matter a lot to the company, but Cisco is only expecting 0%-1% growth in switching and routing over the next 3-5 years.|Emerging market opportunities for Cisco and CienaThe great imponderable for 2014 will be emerging market telco spending. Cisco's outlook for emerging markets was extremely weak, and if taken at face value, it's hard not to be cautious. On the other hand, if emerging markets follow developed market trends, expect smart phone penetration and data usage to increase strongly in 2014.|Moreover, many emerging market countries have the opportunity to jump to next-generation technologies like 4G/LTE, rather than invest in 3G or maintaining legacy infrastructure. Again, this might play to the strengths of Ciena rather than Cisco. However, Cisco has set the bar so low with regard its emerging market prospects that any upside surprise is likely to be well-received.

(XOM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.5% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $110 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.16 bid, annualizes to an additional 2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost), for a total of 4.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $110 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XOM shares would have to climb 9.3% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 11.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.|The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Exxon Mobil Corp., highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $110 strike in red:

What will also not be changing anytime soon is the practice of Dividend Aristocrat stocks such as Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, and Exxon Mobil increasing dividends on a yearly basis.|That is why legendary investor Warren Buffett is a major shareholder of each of those blue-chips.

However, 2013 saw this highflying, housing-focused mega-retailer's growth moderate somewhat as a number of nonfinancial components have outpaced Home Depot in year-to-date gains:|A 35% year-to-date growth rate is nothing to sneeze at, but it's hardly the supersized gains Home Depot investors have gotten used to since 2009. What kept Home Depot from trouncing the pack again this year? It could be weakening expectations, a weakening performance, or just a leveling-off of investor interest thanks to a variety of housing-related factors. Let's examine Home Depot's recent results to see whether that could be the cause of its relative slowdown this year.|In a year marked by valuation growth across the market, Home Depot has done much to earn its gains -- a 23% improvement in earnings per share nearly lines up with the company's share price growth. In fact, Home Depot's P/E hasn't grown at all this year, which is more than you can say for any of its Dow-component peers from the original chart:|In our look ahead to Home Depot's 2014 potential, we've already seen that the company expects to continue posting double-digit earnings growth. In fact, its stated 17% EPS growth guidance is better than that expected of its Dow component peers on this chart: Analysts expect a 14% growth rate for Disney, a 12% growth rate for Boeing, a decrease of 1% in Merck's (NYSE: MRK) earnings, and a 4% growth rate for General Electric (NYSE: GE) . Home Depot's actual P/E ratio, which sits at 22 as of this writing, is nearer the low end of this pack (GE's P/E is the lowest at 21) than the high end (Merck's is more than 33), which offers a bit of wiggle room in this valuation-driven market expansion. So what gives?|Home Depot certainly hasn't disappointed Wall Street this year -- it has beaten estimates in each of its past four quarters, and its most recent report also showed an impressive 7.4% rise in same-store sales, which is an envious figure for any retailer even close to Home Depot's size. As Fool contributor Joseph Solitro notes, Home Depot also had better revenue growth and net margin growth than peer Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) in the third quarter. To top things off, good news continues to flow from the housing sector despite fears of a 2014 taper. Housing starts absolutely soared in November, showing one of the fastest monthly rates seen in years:|Home Depot isn't being held back by its fundamentals, it's not losing steam in its forward guidance, and the housing sector doesn't appear to be on the verge of a retrenchment. Long-term investors can probably conclude that the only reason Home Depot didn't have a better year was that major money simply wasn't as enthusiastic about the specialty retailer as it once was. That's an envious problem to have, and it's not likely to last over the long haul, as Home Depot has given investors no reason to doubt it, either in this year or the next.|The Motley Fool recommends Home Depot and Walt Disney.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.06. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.2% return against the $65 commitment, or a 3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares decline 20.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $62.94 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.06 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3% annualized rate of return.|Worth considering, is that the annualized 3% figure actually exceeds the 1.9% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc by 1.1%, based on the current share price of $81.64. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 20.34% to reach the $65 strike price.

The cost of the medical device tax (from $200 million to $250 million) did not appear to affect the company's broader value.|However, because Johnson & Johnson is a large and multifaceted outfit, the company should continue to see long-term growth as the medical device sector evolves and new pharmaceuticals are brought to the market. Currently, the share price is expensive and could be trading at a premium.

In the weeks before the cattle were shipped to Tyson's slaughterhouse, outside the city limits of Pasco, all had been fed Merck & Co Inc's profit-enhancing animal feed additive, Zilmax.|The day after the hoofless animals were euthanized on August 6, Tyson told its feedlot customers it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. After Reuters reported the existence of a videotape of apparently lame Zilmax-fed animals - shown by an official of meatpacking giant JBS USA LLC at a trade meeting in Colorado - Merck itself temporarily suspended sales of the drug in the U.S. and Canada. The rest of the nation's leading meatpackers soon followed Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor.|Merck, in a statement to Reuters, stressed the safety of its product. It said the company investigates all reports of adverse reactions to its drugs, and did so after the deaths near Pasco.|"Several third-party experts were brought in to evaluate the situation, review the data and identify potential causes for the hoof issue," Merck's statement said. "The findings from the investigation showed that the hoof loss was not due to the fact these animals had received Zilmax."|Merck declined to identify the names of the third-party investigators or provide more detail on the research findings.|After temporarily halting Zilmax sales, Merck continues to state Zilmax is safe when used as directed, with no welfare concerns discovered in 30 research studies since the product was introduced in the United States in 2007. In addition, Merck said, the company is planning more field evaluations of Zilmax, using "a well-designed collection and analysis of data by third-party industry experts." A "prominent" epidemiologist and veterinarian will oversee the work, Merck said.|Federal law requires Merck to report all animal deaths, as well as any other adverse reactions, in connection with use of its products. A review of reports submitted by Merck and others to the FDA shows at least 285 cattle have died unexpectedly or been destroyed in the United States after being fed Zilmax since the drug was introduced in 2007. The FDA reports specify the ailments that led to the unexpected deaths, but do not consistently state whether the animals expired on their own or were euthanized.|Merck Animal Health, the unit that markets the additive, said proper use of Zilmax "does not affect the safety or well-being of cattle." Moving beyond the 30 studies it cited at the time it suspended Zilmax sales, Merck in August launched an audit of how the product was being used in the field, created an advisory board to review management practices in the feedlot and animal nutrition industries, and provided new funds for field research on Zilmax-fed cattle.|Merck has begun approaching cattle nutritionists, livestock academics and other professionals who influence opinion in an effort to gain industry insight and win support for the return of the drug, according to several people who have met with the company.|The agency said it has taken no action related to Zilmax. When asked for comment about the adverse-event reports filed by Merck, an FDA spokeswoman in a statement said the agency "has not reached any conclusions on the safety of Zilmax but the agency is continuing to receive and evaluate data. As part of this process, the agency is always interested in new information."|The Merck suspension of Zilmax sales is voluntary, and at this point the company could return Zilmax to the market without seeking permission from the FDA.|Zilmax was worth nearly $160 million in annual sales in the United States and Canada last year, and was a steady cash generator for Merck's animal health business, which has about $3.3 billion in global sales.|Merck's Zilmax quickly developed a loyal customer base. Its popularity spread even to the show circuit, where ranchers' children today can win prizes exceeding $100,000 for raising big-girth bovines.|Tyson and rival beef processor Cargill Inc have told Reuters they will not accept Zilmax-fed cattle until Merck can provide a scientific vetting of Zilmax's safety to animals and the companies are confident any animal welfare issues are resolved. (Cargill says it didn't see the cattle lameness problems cited by JBS and Tyson.)|In August this year, Merck reported an additional five episodes involving 66 cattle in Oregon and Idaho that lost their hooves after a Zilmax feeding regimen. In some cases, a consulting veterinarian also cited high ambient temperature and a cement-and-rebar floor that may have exacerbated the hoof damage.|Wilson said Beef Northwest had never faced lameness problems with its Zilmax-fed animals before this summer. While Beef Northwest was dispensing Zilmax, Wilson said, the company strictly followed Merck's dosage and other instructions.|Merck is now trying to win the industry back. At a closed-door session of an Academy of Veterinary Consultants conference in Denver on December 5, some 300 cattle veterinarians sparred over Zilmax.|The veterinarians debated the effects of Zilmax and other beta-agonist drugs, Moczygemba said, without reaching a conclusion.

But Google Inc (GOOG) is used to huge success in virtually every field that it enters into, so what are the prospects for Chromebook in 2014? Can it continue its rapid ascent and grab even more market share?

Over the past five fiscal years, the company succeeded in growing revenue by 55.7% from $721.6 million to $1.12 billion. This growth rate is smaller than the $105.2% jump experienced by Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NASDAQ: DECK) , but larger than the 32% increase seen by Nike (NYSE: NKE) .|Though the company sits in the middle of these two competitors in terms of revenue growth, its bottom line has improved at a much more rapid pace. Over the past five years, the company has seen its net loss of $185.1 million turn into a net profit of $131.3 million. Meanwhile, Nike's net income has increased by 67.1% from $1.49 billion to $2.49 billion. Deckers Outdoor's net income has seen slightly better results with a 74.4% rise in profitability from $73.9 million to $128.9 million, even in light of rising raw materials costs.|Year-to-date, however, business has faltered, leading investors to wonder what the future might look like for Crocs. Looking at the company's third fiscal quarter, we can see that its revenue has risen by 2.4% to $288.5 million this year compared to the $295.6 million the company brought in during the same quarter last year. Deckers Outdoor, on the other hand, has experienced a modest 2.7% rise in revenue, while Nike blows both companies out of the water with a 7.7% increase.|The same can be true for Crocs's bottom line. As of its most recent quarter, the company's net income has fallen a steep 71.2% from $45.1 million to $13 million. Deckers Outdoor also saw a decrease in profitability, but not to the same extend. Compared to the same quarter last year, net income has fallen 23.2% from $43.1 million to $33.1 million. Unlike both Crocs and Deckers Outdoor, Nike is the only shoemaker of the bunch to see its profitability improve. Compared to the same quarter last year, the company's most recent net income figure rose 37.6% from $567 million to a mouthwatering $780 million.|Talk about beautiful assets!Currently, the company has a very attractive balance sheet. On top of having a current ratio of 3.5 (which includes $332.5 million in cash), the company trades at only 1.9 times book value. In juxtaposition, Deckers Outdoor has a current ratio of 1.82 (with very little cash on hand) and trades at 3.87 times book value. Nike, as a large company with a nice economic moat, trades at a far higher 6.21 times book value, but has a current ratio of 3.53 to help bolster its attractiveness.|Foolish takeawayYear-to-date, Crocs hasn't been doing too well, but its results over the past five years have been stellar. More likely than not, Blackstone believes that management (especially after the retirement of the company's CEO next April) will be able to turn business around. While this remains to be seen, the company is less than half the size of Deckers Outdoor and a mere 2% the size of Nike. This suggests that, if management can make the brand more appealing to consumers, it has plenty of potential for consuming market share. Based on how cheap the business is, any sign of a turnaround could mean significant upside for investors even from this level.

The leading segment in the shoe market is men's and women's casual/dress shoes, making up about 40% of the market. That's one of Brown Shoe's key markets.|Yet, it's not all about the casual space--Brown Shoe is also seeing strength in the athletic space. For Q3, the No. 1 running shoe in all of athletic selling was Nike's Flex, which is a shoe that Brown Shoe carries. That's the first time this has ever happened for Brown Shoe.|Meanwhile, Nike continues to do a killer job. The stock is growing nicely despite its size, and it has an impressive opportunity in Asia. China has been a lag for the shoe company in the past year or so, but it's looking to turn that around. Its August-ended quarter showed that future orders were up 8% year over year compared to 6% for the same quarter last year. And the good news? China saw future orders up 3%.

Moreover, retailers like Foot Locker (NYSE: FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) have recently confirmed many of the strong trends that Nike is seeing in North America. Looking into 2014, the soccer World Cup will provide an obvious upside kicker to Nike's prospects, but is all the good news already priced in?|Nike reports a strong second quarterThe sporting giant is unusual in the consumer goods sector because its growth in recent years has been coming from developed markets (principally the US), while its emerging market performance has been disappointing.|As such, the rise in Western Europe (revenue grew 18% and futures orders were up 26%) demonstrates Nike's ability to turn around performance with a strategic reset. This is precisely what the company intends to do in China as well.|North America (and to a lesser extent footwear) remains the powerhouse of Nike's operations. While investors have a right to be skeptical as to how long Nike can continue to rely on North America for growth, signs from the industry continue to indicate strength. For example, Dick's Sporting Goods reported same-store sales growth of 3.3% in its last quarter, significantly above its expectation of flat to minus 1%. Furthermore, on the conference call management outlined that "third quarter comparable store sales growth" was "led by strength in athletic footwear and apparel and team sports."|Nike's results nicely mirrored what Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods said, in that average selling prices are going up amid ongoing strength in footwear.|However, the good news doesn't stop there because Nike is set for a strong year in 2014.|Nike's growth catalystsThe coming year promises to be a strong one for a variety of reasons:|The World Cup in Brazil will generate strong interest in Nike's football products, especially with Nike's sponsorship of the host nation|E-commerce revenue grew 35% in the third quarter, and Nike is in the process of launching new country sites and expanding merchandising in others|However, the most important long-term consideration is likely to be Nike's strategic reset in China. The early indications are positive, with revenue from China rising 5% in the quarter. On the other hand, anyone who thinks the battle is won should note the guidance provided on the recent conference call:|Where to next for Nike?As ever, the key thing for investors is to try and take a snapshot of what Nike will look like in the future. Its 2014 fiscal year (ending in May) looks to be ending on a strong note, and positive sentiment is likely to remain for the World Cup in the summer. Furthermore, analysts expect Nike to grow revenue and earnings per share by 8.8% and 17%, respectively, for the year to May 2015.|While it all looks rosy, Foolish investors should note that this implies that the stock is trading for more than 22 times its expected earnings to 2015. A lot of good news is baked into the stock price, and any slowdown in Nike's performance in North America or a failure to execute the strategic reset in China could leave the stock exposed. After the World Cup, the market will start asking "where next?" and the focus will shift onto Nike's emerging market performance.|Is Nike the Fool's favorite stock for 2014?There's a huge difference between a good stock, and a stock that can make you rich.

The report noted a strong quarterly dividend history at Pfizer Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.|The annualized dividend paid by Pfizer Inc is $1.04/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 02/05/2014. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for PFE, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past dividend history can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.
http://www.thestreet.com/story/12189257/1/one-put-one-call-option-to-know-about-for-procter-amp-gamble.html|12/30/2013|0|"Procter & Gamble" OR "Procter And Gamble"|0|One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Procter & Gamble|Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Procter & Gamble (PG). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for PG. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.27. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.2% return against the $70 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to PG's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Procter & Gamble sees its shares fall 14.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $67.73 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.27 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return.|Interestingly, that annualized 3.1% figure actually exceeds the 3% annualized dividend paid by Procter & Gamble, based on the current share price of $81.78. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 14.46% to reach the $70 strike price.|Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Procter & Gamble, looking at the dividend history chart for PG below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annualized dividend yield.

What will also not be changing anytime soon is the practice of Dividend Aristocrat stocks such as Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, and Exxon Mobil increasing dividends on a yearly basis.|That is why legendary investor Warren Buffett is a major shareholder of each of those blue-chips. Although there might be a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the future for Chicago if it follows Detroit, there are definitely dividend increases ahead for the shareholders of Dividend Aristocrat stocks such Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil, and Coca-Cola.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/30/is-barrons-wrong-about-coca-cola.aspx|12/30/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|1|Is Barron's Wrong About Coca-Cola?|Last weekend's edition of Barron's ran a bullish article on Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) . The gist of the article is that poor weather caused Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) to ramp up advertising and discounts in 2013, but a return to rational pricing and a rising global middle class will boost earnings in the years ahead. Moreover, Coca-Cola trades at 18 times next year's estimated earnings and therefore makes a good investment.|I find little to squabble with as far as Barron's analysis of Coca-Cola's business prospects go: Although carbonated-soft-drink volumes continue to decline in the United States, there is enormous untapped growth in international markets where per capita consumption of Coke is much lower than it is in North America. Emerging markets will drive growth for decades. However, there is reason to doubt that Coca-Cola is a good investment at this price; one of its close peers may be a better investment instead.|First, let's determine the attractiveness of Coca-Cola relative to PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE: DPS) , and the S&P 500 index based on three measures: price to earnings, price to free cash flow, and price to sales. Coca-Cola trades at a premium to its peers and the S&P 500 in all three categories. (Note: S&P 500 free cash flow is not readily calculable and has been left out.)|That Coca-Cola trades at a premium does not automatically disqualify it as a good investment. Coca-Cola is a better company than most in the S&P 500; most companies do not have the scale, market dominance, and growth opportunities available to Coca-Cola, so it deserves to trade at a premium to the market.|Coca-Cola is also a better company than Dr Pepper Snapple. Dr Pepper Snapple has the third-largest share of the carbonated-soft-drink market and owns many brands that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective categories. However, it is inferior to Coca-Cola in two important ways.|Secondly, Dr Pepper Snapple lacks the scale and distribution capability to expand internationally at a meaningful pace. The company is expanding at an excruciatingly slow pace as it builds its distribution network in the Caribbean, which makes up 7.6% of sales. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, already has worldwide distribution capabilities and can easily take advantage of increases in per-capita consumption in international markets.|Coca-Cola's edge over PepsiCo, however, is not obvious. Like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo owns a portfolio of leading beverage brands that it can distribute worldwide through its system of bottlers and distributors. It has a 26% share of the U.S. liquid-refreshment beverages market, second only to Coca-Cola's 34% share. But PepsiCo has something that Coca-Cola does not have: diversification from the beverage market.|Given that PepsiCo has as much exposure to the carbonated-soft-drink market as Coca-Cola and owns a wide-moat snacks business, it is difficult to fathom why it trades at a discount to its larger rival. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are both wide-moat businesses that generate similar returns on equity and returns on invested capital. Therefore, they should trade in line with each other. That PepsiCo trades at a discount indicates that there is a better alternative to an investment in Coca-Cola.|Absolute valuationEven if PepsiCo were not available to buy at a relative discount, Coca-Cola does not seem particularly attractive based on its historical financial performance. In the last 10 years, Coca-Cola turned $100 of sales into $19.65 in free cash flow -- on average -- although that number has been declining.|If you apply Coca-Cola's historical free cash flow margin -- 19.6% -- to its current sales level -- $47 billion -- you get an initial "normal" free cash flow estimate of $9.3 billion. This is $1.3 billion more free cash flow than Coca-Cola has ever generated in its history.|Even working off this record estimate of free cash flow, Coca-Cola trades at just a 5% free cash flow yield. That is, $9.3 billion in free cash flow divided by $184 billion (the company's market price) equals 5%. If you just take the last four quarters of free cash flow -- $8 billion -- you get a 4.3% free cash flow yield. In order for an investor to get a double-digit return on an investment in Coca-Cola, the company would need to grow free cash flow at 5% to 6% per year. In other words, investors have to pay up for growth.|Bottom lineBarron's and I agree that Coca-Cola is a wonderful business with good prospects despite heated anti-soda rhetoric in the United States. We also agree that it trades at something close to 20 times its normal earning power. Where we disagree is the wisdom of paying for growth, especially when PepsiCo can be had for less. Why pay up for Coca-Cola when you can buy PepsiCo -- a company with similar, if not better, prospects -- at a cheaper price?|Warren Buffett hasn't bought more Coca-Cola in years. What is he buying?Warren Buffett has made billions through his investing and he wants you to be able to invest like him.

In the second quarter of 2013, for instance, it posted a 1% dip in North American sales followed by a 2% incline in the subsequent third quarter. This teetering movement in sales in part reflects the fast-changing consumer habits and attitudes in the US market.|PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) , Coca-Cola's closest competitor, has also been compelled to adjust to changes in consumer attitudes. The New York-based beverage heavyweight is working on alternative sweeteners drawn out from natural sources like stevia. PepsiCo has also continually grown its US snack business to hedge against headwinds in the beverage industry. In the third quarter of 2013, for instance, sales volumes in the snack business were three times greater than volumes in the beverage business.|In light of the continued shifts in major market factors in the US beverage market as well as Coca-Cola's disappointing Q3 earnings, a section of investors have minimized exposure to Coca-Cola in favor of PepsiCo, which seems to have a better handle on things. Indeed, Coca-Cola's stock appreciated only 11.7% in the past year compared with PepsiCo, which rose 21% for the same period. However, picking PepsiCo over Coca-Cola for the long term is the wrong play. Coca-Cola presents far greater rewards for a long-term buy-and-hold investor.|PepsiCo's share price movement a red flagOn the surface, PepsiCo is a better investment than Coca-Cola. Its dividend of $2.27 a share is notably higher than Coca-Cola's $1.12 a share. To sweeten the pot, PepsiCo's yield, which is the dividend as a percentage of the share price, matches Coca-Cola's 2.8%.|However, PepsiCo's share-price movement in the past year is a red flag. PepsiCo's shares have a 52-week price range of $67.39-$87.06. This is a far wider than Coca-Cola's 52-week price range of $35.58 - $43.43.|Although PepsiCo is currently trading at around $82, which is intimately close to its 52-week high, its relatively wide 52-week range suggests a level of elasticity that can easily reverse its bullish run. Unlike Coca-Cola, which has a heavier presence in global markets, PepsiCo is overly exposed to the US market.|Given the elasticity of its share price relative to Coca-Cola's, the ongoing shift in major market factors in the US is likely produce greater up and down movements in its stock relative to Coca-Cola's going forward.|Coca-Cola's emerging market strategy reassuringCoca-Cola's performances in China and India are reassuring. Emerging markets not only present great upside, but the market factors, or elements that steer demand, are far simpler and rarely change. For most of Africa, for instance, the greatest market factor has for a long time remained the high population growth rate.|China remains a key focal point in Coca-Cola's global strategy. The beverage market potential, or the total addressable market for beverages, is expected to expand 40% in the next five years in China, the world's second-largest economy. Inline with this, Coca-Cola has been aggressively increasing its presence in the country. It invested $3 billion in China between 2009 and 2011, and recently set up its 43rd bottling plant in the country as part of the larger $4 billion investment plan for 2012-2014. In addition, it has announced plans to invest a further $4 billion for 2015-2017.|Coca-Cola can leverage its strong distribution networks to support its expansion into global markets. Its strong cash position also allows it to hire locals and conduct corporate social-responsibility programs in emerging markets, enabling it to fill crucial technical and cultural gaps. Capitalizing on untapped potential in emerging markets not only offsets swings in the US market, but also provides a crucial lift for the entire business.|Foolish takeawayAlthough PepsiCo looks attractive, its share price movement, coupled with its heavier exposure to the highly-dynamic US food and beverage market, presents too much uncertainty to make a solid long-term decision. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, despite slower share price growth in the past year, presents more clarity into the future.|The current bearishness surrounding Coca-Cola presents the perfect entry point for investors. At around $40 a share, it is relatively cheap, presenting both modest upside in the near time and far greater upside in the long-term.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for VZ. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $38 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.02. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.7% return against the $38 commitment, or a 2.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to VZ's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Verizon Communications sees its shares decline 22.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $36.98 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.02 from $38), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.6% annualized rate of return.|Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2015 expiration, for shareholders of Verizon Communications (VZ) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 4.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $52.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.69 bid, annualizes to an additional 3.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost), for a total of 7.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $52.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but VZ shares would have to climb 6.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.|The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Verizon Communications, highlighting in green where the $38 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $52.50 strike in red:

Specifically, the growing popularity of same-day delivery could make it easier for companies like Wal-Mart to compete directly with Amazon.|Amazon.com is building a network of distribution centers to service such networks around the country, but there's already a company that has a network of 42 such centers in place in the U.S. It's (surprise!) Wal-Mart, which also owns Sam's Club. Wal-Mart's website notes that each center operates 24/7 and contains 5.5 billion cases of merchandise.|Opportunity for Wal-Mart and CostcoIt wouldn't be too hard for Wal-Mart to start shipping merchandise directly to customers from distribution centers using regional shippers. Wal-Mart and Sam's Club already have experience in online retail and fast delivery.

The Postal Service is also delivering some shipments for Amazon on Sundays in New York and Los Angeles.

Online delivery also means that people will be able to shop at Wal-Mart without actually going to Wal-Mart. Instead of Amazon.com going after Wal-Mart and Costco, Wal-Mart and Costco might soon be coming after Amazon.com.|Amazon.com should definitely be worried about Wal-Mart because the discount giant reported TTM revenue of $475.11 billion on Oct. 31, 2013. Amazon.com reported TTM revenue of $70.12 billion on Sept. 30, 2013--that's less than a fourth of Wal-Mart's revenues.

However, it still moves workers away from traditional pension plans and replaces it with a 401(k)-style retirement plan. Consequently, local union leaders have urged members to reject the contract. If they do, it could put an end to contract negotiations.

However, there are things investors should keep in mind, regardless of how the vote goes.|First, there are a number of other states offering Boeing incentives to move production of the 777X. But that would also prove to be time-consuming and costly for the company, not to mention that the Machinists union is already skilled at making Boeing's planes. More importantly, Boeing only began selling the 777X in May, but it's already garnered significant sales. If Boeing decides to move, that could delay deliveries of the 777X.|On the flip side, if Boeing pulls production of its 777X from Washington, that could have a significant impact on Washington's credit rating. Bloomberg reports that the loss of jobs and tax revenue could result in a credit downgrade, which is something no state wants to face.|In short, there are strong incentives for Boeing and the union to come to an agreement -- eventually.

So, yes, Boeing's sales look like they'll bring in sizable revenues. But to keep expenses down over the long haul, especially for sales prices fixed in advance, Boeing has to know they won't be squeezed by the unions once the production line is set up. For this they need to keep expenses not only low but under contract to stay low in a union environment. The lack of such a contract is why Boeing may relocate some production to a low-cost area in a non-union state, as their best bet.|Those massive launch orders undoubtedly came at rock-bottom prices, against fierce competition, and Boeing does not want to repeat a situation where they have to deliver hundreds of airplanes of a new model before becoming profitable.|No the Union will not accept the Billion$ in takeaways while Boeing just announced $10 billion in stock buybacks and more in dividend increase.

Despite increases in global mining activity, the industry remains depressed. U.S. coal consumption is expected to rise 4.4% this year, but low prices for coal itself haven't been able to offset the competitively low price seen in natural gas. As a result, the Energy Information Administration says that through October, domestic coal production has fallen nearly 2%. Moreover, as Europe remains mired in economic malaise and international markets, particularly China, produce more of their own supplies, exports are down more than 8%. Overall, global coal demand will grow at an average rate of just 2.3% per year through 2018, but that's not likely to help many miners advance.|In addition to the collapse experienced by Caterpillar, industry peer Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) witnessed a 36% dissipation of new-order bookings due to coal's problems as nearly two-thirds of the heavy-equipment maker's revenues are derived from the industry, in both thermal and metallurgical markets. Yet it's not any better in iron ore either as it confronts a similarly weak demand environment despite low pricing.|Miners everywhere are curtailing investments heeding the call by Glencore Xstrata to initiate a new "age of austerity" in the words of one analyst. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Vale have all cut capital expenditures, sold non-core projects, and are focusing only on those assets that play to their strengths. In such a world, it becomes increasingly difficult for Caterpillar or anyone else for that matter to sell much new equipment.|Cat's still counting on recovery in U.S. construction markets to underpin its own reversal of fortunes and with Deere (NYSE: DE) actually recording somewhat better results for November, Big Yellow may yet pull it off. Deere said its "first in the dirt" and settlement sales of construction and forestry equipment were higher by single digits, but Caterpillar's big bet on mining with its purchase of Bucyrus International in 2011 may make that a moot point.|It's not a pretty picture for the heavy-equipment maker, indicating that it still has a long way to go before it can plow its way out of this hole. Fourth-quarter dealer inventories are expected to decline significantly more. Investors ought to consider that if Caterpillar's business is bad and is going to get worse, how long will it be before we see global economic indices follow suit?|Caterpillar can still be a good, long-term play because mining is cyclical and when it does come back it will be well positioned.

But even with that strong performance, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) have largely missed out on the Dow's strong performance, with IBM having posted a loss for the year and Caterpillar rising just 3%. Some value investors have started gravitating toward those beaten-down stocks, arguing that they're due for a rebound. But does history bear that theory out? Let's take a look at the past performance of lagging Dow stocks and what it says about the following year.|How 2012's laggards did The idea that a bad year for a stock's performance should result in a future good year is a popular one, especially among investors in solid companies with little threat of permanent failure. In the business world, many trends are cyclical, and out-of-favor stocks often come back into favor and bring huge returns to those who had confidence in their turnaround stories. That hope is what's making bottom-fishing investors look at Caterpillar and IBM as prospective improving investments for 2014.|A long time comingEven IBM and Caterpillar themselves point to the fact that a bounce-back from poor performance isn't a sure thing. Caterpillar rose only 2% in 2012, but persistent poor conditions in the construction industry, combined with new challenges among mining companies in the face of plunging commodities prices, have extended the heavy-equipment maker's poor performance. Caterpillar itself sees weak conditions potentially lasting for years, putting a ceiling over the stock's appreciation potential.|IBM and Caterpillar are likely to recover eventually, as they've both shown histories of bouncing back from cyclical downturns. But you shouldn't necessarily count on their posting the strongest returns among the Dow stocks in 2014. Sometimes, it takes longer for turnarounds to make themselves complete.|Take the long-term viewIt's no secret that investors tend to be impatient with lagging stocks like Caterpillar and IBM, but your best investment strategy remains to buy shares in solid businesses and keep them for the long term. In the special free report, "3 Stocks That Will Help You Retire Rich," The Motley Fool shares investment ideas and strategies that could help you build wealth for years to come. Click here to grab your free copy today.|Earnings will be higher in 2014 for both stocks, so it is likely the stock price will be higher for both of them. You should at least get the earnings growth rate plus the dividends plus the buy back %. IBM should give you the most appreciation of the two with a dividend yield of 2% + EPS growth rate of 7% + buyback of 10%. I think the worst case for IBM is an increase of 10% total return which is a low expectation. Caterpillar is already valued at a much higher P/E so even on good news such as meeting the lowered earnings expectation, it has less room to run. I'm buying both stocks for long-term investment but for 2014 IBM should do better.

One region in particular, however, stands out in terms of its expected contribution to the company's production growth over the next few years. Let's take a closer look.|Chevron's huge growth runway in the Gulf That region is the Gulf of Mexico, where the company plans to spend almost $12 billion to develop projects such as Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot. Though the deepwater Gulf of Mexico contributed less production than Chevron's other operating regions such as Latin America and Africa, the company's Gulf production is poised to accelerate rapidly over the next few years, as three of its largest Gulf projects, including Jack/St. Malo, Big Foot, and Tubular Bells, start up next year.|Jack/St. Malo will involve the development of the Jack and St. Malo oilfields, two massive fields in which Chevron holds a 50% interest, with Maersrk and Statoil (NYSE: STO) each owning 25% of the balance. At full capacity, the $7.5 billion project will produce 177,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 88,500 BOE/d will be net to Chevron.|Similarly, Big Foot is another massive oilfield located roughly 225 miles south of New Orleans in water depths of 5,200 feet. The field will be developed by Chevron, which serves as the operator with a 60% interest, as well as Statoil and Marubeni Oil & Gas, which hold 27.5% and 12.5% interests, respectively, using a dry tree Extended Tension Leg Platform with an onboard drilling rig. The project will have a production capacity of 79,000 BOE/d, with 47,500 BOE/d net to Chevron.|Lastly, Tubular Bells is located about 135 miles south of New Orleans in water depths of about 4,300 feet. The $3 billion project is operated by Hess (NYSE: HES) , which holds a 57.14% working interest, in partnership with Chevron, which holds the remaining 42.86% interest. It will be developed using a production facility consisting of a subsea wet tree infrastructure tied to a three-level topside structure, with a peak production capacity of 40,000 to 45,000 BOE/D, with 17,150 to 19,300 BOE/d of production net to Chevron.|The combined impact of these three projects coming online will be truly massive. At full capacity, they should contribute more than 150,000 BOE/d of net production, representing a more than doubling of Chevron's 2012 production level of 125,000 BOE/d in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.|The future of Gulf drilling Chevron's not the only company investing heavily in the Gulf of Mexico. BP (NYSE: BP) plans to invest at least $4 billion per year to develop its vast portfolio of projects in the Gulf over the next 10 years. Despite the ongoing fallout from the 2010 Gulf Oil spill, the British oil giant is the largest producer and leaseholder in the Gulf, with a company record of nine rigs currently operating in the region.|The bottom line In addition to its tremendous growth opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron has significant operations in Latin America and Africa, where it is a top-tier producer in Angola, Nigeria, and Venezuela and has 15 major projects slated to start up through 2017. It also boasts strong positions in leading U.S. resource plays, especially the Permian Basin.|Overall, Chevron has a nice mix of high-margin oil and gas projects providing near-term production and cash flow growth, balanced with long-lived projects that should provide strong and predictable production and cash flows for decades to come. If the company can avoid further cost overruns and delays at its Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG ventures in Australia, these projects should provide a major boost to production and cash flows when they come online in mid-2015 and 2016, respectively.|A name that OPEC dreads to hearWhile Chevron and its peers are turning to long-lived LNG projects to help offset declining production from their mature fields, one energy company continues to mint profits. Imagine a company that rents a very specific and valuable piece of machinery for $41,000 per hour. (That's almost as much as the average American makes in a year!)

Therefore, while Sears remains No. 1 in annual installation calls (14 million per year), consumers are attempting to do as much as they can on their own these days.

Furthermore, Home Depot yields a 2% dividend.|Divesting and investingOver the past two years, Sears has spun off Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, Orchard Supply Hardware Stores, and now Lands' End.

Headquartered in Minnesota, the company operates through two business units, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, which serve more than 85 million individuals. UnitedHealth has aggressively expanded through acquisitions over the past decade -- Oxford Health Plans, PacifiCare Health Systems and Sierra Health Services -- and it now operates in all 50 states in the U.S. and 20 other countries worldwide. Because of its leadership in the health-insurance industry, UnitedHealth became only the second insurer (and first health insurer) ever added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2012.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Teva began paying quarterly dividends in 1990, and it has been paying ever since. However, Teva's 24-year long dividend-paying streak merely matches that of UnitedHealth, which began paying annual dividends in 1990 and continued the practice for nearly two decades before switching to quarterly payments in 2010. This round produces a rare tie between our two competitors.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Teva has been increasing its shareholder distributions at least once every year since 2003 for a decade-long dividend-raising streak. UnitedHealth, on the other hand, held its dividend payouts steady for several years before quarterly payouts began in 2010. According to Dividata, UnitedHealth's dividend-raising streak only began that year. The drugmaker wins this round easily.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Teva and UnitedHealth have tied in the best-of-five battle, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth. Let's dig into each company's opportunities to find out which stock truly offers better opportunities for dividend investors today.|Aflac could capture share from UnitedHealth and other health insurers.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Teva has a slightly better shot at long-term outperformance, thanks to its strong pipeline of both patented and generic drugs, as well as new business partnerships. UnitedHealth has access to some lucrative insurance markets, but Obamacare could weaken its core insurance business, particularly if regulations tighten further after the program's 2014 rollout truly tests the system's stability. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others.

Moreover, as Boeing reports, the ScanEagle is ideal for loitering "over trouble spots and provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data, or communications relay." This will help Iraqi forces locate terrorist groups, and hopefully stem the growing tide of violence.|This also represents why defense contractors, like Boeing, make great long-term investments. It's an unfortunate fact that the world is a violent place, and defense companies provide something that's always in demand -- military assets. In this case, hopefully the military assets will be used to save civilians' lives.|What to watch The growing civilian death toll in the Middle East is horrible, but hopefully, the recently acquired U.S. aid will help put a stop to it. Moreover, while the potential sale of ScanEagle drones isn't a significant source of revenue for Boeing, it does highlight why defense giants like Boeing make ideal long-term investments -- as of its third-quarter report, Boeing had a $70 billion defense, space, and security backlog, and 38% of that was from international orders.

In fact, these stocks hold valuation multiples in excess of the broader market, but their world-class brand strength provides a meaningful margin of safety. This means skittish investors still have plenty of reason to buy these great stocks.|Great brands are a margin of safetyProcter & Gamble's stable of high-quality brands collectively brought more than $80 billion in sales into the company's coffers last year. A few of these fantastic brands include Bounty paper towels, Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent, Gillette razors, and Crest toothpaste. P&G points investors to its 50 leadership brands, which cumulatively account for 90% of the company's products. Twenty-five of these 50 brands generate more than $1 billion in annual sales each.|Consider that Procter & Gamble has paid uninterrupted dividends for an amazing 123 years in a row, every year since its incorporation all the way back in 1890. Furthermore, P&G has increased its dividend for 57 years in a row. Almost as impressive, Colgate-Palmolive has an enviable dividend streak itself: The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1895. Meanwhile, Clorox recently raised its dividend for the 36thconsecutive year.|However, it's also true that these great companies offer investors access to strong brands that are used in both good economies and bad. This in itself represents a margin of safety. And, thanks to these companies' strong track records of paying and raising dividends every year, investors don't need to be scared off just because of their earnings multiples. As a result, Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Colgate-Palmolive can still be bought and held with confidence.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/28/when-titans-collide-coke-vs-pepsi.aspx|12/28/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|0|Coke vs. Pepsi--the age-old debate. While this debate usually revolves around the flavors of these two beverage makers, I am going to take a look at the companies' growth prospects going into 2014. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) shares are only up a modest 10% year-to-date, while PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) has had a much better year with its shares up almost 20%. So which of these soda titans will have a better 2014 ?|SalesWhile on the surface Pepsi and Coca-Cola look like very similar companies, that simply isn't the case. Coca-Cola collects 75% of its revenue from the sale of its carbonated beverages, while Pepsi only makes 25% of its revenue from the sale of carbonated drinks. The bulk of Pepsi's revenue comes from its food division that owns popular brands such as Frito-Lay.|Sales of carbonated beverages in the United States may be affected by anti-sugary drink legislation. Right off the bat it's clear that one company, Coca-Cola, will be more affected by legislation aimed at banning sugary drinks, such as New York's sugary-drink ban. Due to Coca-Cola's lack of diversity in the products it manufactures, which are heavily beverage-related, the company will struggle to bolster sales with American soda demand slowly declining.|Volume in the American, Latin American, European, and Asian food businesses gained about 3%, led by double-digit growth in China, Pakistan, and Turkey. These encouraging pieces of data bolstered Pepsi's sales numbers in the third quarter but really didn't do much for Coca-Cola.|To take advantage of this growth both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have increased their presences in the region. Coca-Cola opened a bottling plant in Myanmar on June 4th. Forbes reported that the company also plans to invest $200 million in Myanmar over the next five years.|While Coca-Cola seems to have a bit of a head start in Myanmar, its facilities will only help the company gain a share of the region's fast-growing beverage market. Pepsi's approach will create a base from which Pepsi is able to capture market share in both the beverage and snack-food markets.|Foolish takeaway Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi's drink divisions will suffer over the next few years due to declining demand for soda in the domestic market. However, Pepsi will have the upper hand thanks to the diversity of the products it manufactures. Pepsi's popular line of "healthy" drinks, like Tropicana, will also fare well as American consumers demand healthier alternatives to soft drinks.|Because Pepsi will probably be able to offset its weak soft drink sales with increased revenue from snack products, it seems it is in better shape to tackle the food and beverage business in 2014 and beat Coca-Cola in the market again next year.

Russell's comedy/drama about a group of low-level scammers mixing it up with the FBI and the mafia in the late-1970s. The cast is top-notch and the outfits and ridiculous hairdos are seemingly an exact match for the era. Even Russell's dialog occasionally pops with the type of cockeyed dark comedy that his fans have grown to expect, yet "American Hustle" also flounders under the weight of trying to be cooler than it is, ultimately building to a climax that doesn't live up to the promise of the film's opening.|Though it's at least anything but a formulaic bore, "American Hustle" is "Boogie Nights" without Paul Thomas Anderson's visual flair or "Casino without Martin Scorsese's ability to drop us into a place that we feel like we've never been before. "American Hustle" may be a step ahead of the usual Hollywood movie of its type, but it's also a movie that could have been a whole lot more.|In an era before the constant availability of digital records, "American Hustle" takes place in a time when a clever con artist could practically live like a king. Promising easy riches to desperate people looking for loans, Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams) set up a small illegal business and never look back. Even with a pot belly and one of the worst hairdos in history, Irving is a confident and brash con man who seems born to take money from the weak-minded. In a funny early flashback, we see that Irving got his start propping up his father's glass business by throwing rocks through the front windows of local stores. Throw enough rocks and some people are bound to find their way into his father's glass store for a repair.|And if this all sounds like a good bit of fun, in many ways it is. Lawrence in particular is a scene-stealer with her manipulating loud mouth and her constant undermining of the original plan. Often the good girl, Adams also breaks out in a big way as a sultry hustler who knows all she has to do is wear a scandalous dress and break out her British accent to wrap a guy neatly around her finger. Known for devoting himself to a role, Bale is even a good fit as a slippery con man who seems to be a bigger mess than he actually is. After seeing him as rail thin in "The Machinist" and ripped in Christopher Nolan's "Batman" series, "American Hustle" shows again that Bale has an unparalleled commitment to physical detail.|Even with some great individual characters and performances, though, "American Hustle" never takes off and often feels like a screwball comedy dressed up as something else. Despite an indie tone, it comes off as light entertainment in which the consequences never quite appear to be real, leaving us with fun characters who seem to know that everything is going to be all right at the end of the day. In a lot of ways, it's much closer to Steven Soderbergh's "Oceans" trilogy than anything else - a film that ultimately is going to wrap itself up in a bow no matter how bleak the outlook for our characters seems to be.|Yet "American Hustle" is still far from a misfire, and if anything it speaks volumes to Russell's ability to take a run-of-the-mill story and turn it into an entertaining period piece that blends together some of today's best actors. But even with some truly funny dialog and great comedic setups, it never finds a way for us to care about the characters more than on a superficial level. For all its glitz and glamour, "American Hustle" is a fun film that doesn't quite live up to the hype.

American Express (NYSE: AXP) , which had been the Dow's lone credit card issuer for three decades, finally got some company when Visa (NYSE: V) joined the index this fall. However, as you can see in the graph above, Visa's share price growth was a bit less impressive than its premium-branded peer. We've already examined AmEx's impact on the Dow in 2013, but let's take a look at Visa's fundamental performance now to see whether its underperformance was justified relative to a soaring AmEx:|These results are more noteworthy in light of a continued American deleveraging -- revolving debt declined by more than $50 billion between early 2010 and the end of 2012, and average credit card debt per household fell by more than $2,500 over that time frame.

Meanwhile, Cisco stock ranks among the bottom five Dow performers in 2013, with gains of less than 15% since the year kicked off.|Boeing's success has come as the company has pushed to cement its status as the world's dominant aerospace giant. The company's newest 777X and 787 airliners have made substantial progress in orders this year, despite the 787 grounding that headlined the first half of 2013.

Without any major economic news, year-end optimism allowed stocks to coast higher before falling back to earth, but other financial markets saw more momentous events that helped ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) climb even as Travelers (NYSE: TRV) posted declines.|Exxon and Chevron both gained ground Friday morning as the price of front-month futures on West Texas Intermediate crude oil climbed above the $100 mark for the first time since October. Energy prices have risen around the world, with Brent recently climbing above $110 to rival its best levels since before the financial crisis. Exxon's 0.6% gain beat out peer Chevron's rise of 0.3%, continuing the relative outperformance of the larger Dow energy component since Warren Buffett announced his interest in the oil giant.

Without any major economic news, year-end optimism allowed stocks to coast higher before falling back to earth, but other financial markets saw more momentous events that helped ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) climb even as Travelers (NYSE: TRV) posted declines.|Exxon and Chevron both gained ground Friday morning as the price of front-month futures on West Texas Intermediate crude oil climbed above the $100 mark for the first time since October. Energy prices have risen around the world, with Brent recently climbing above $110 to rival its best levels since before the financial crisis. Exxon's 0.6% gain beat out peer Chevron's rise of 0.3%, continuing the relative outperformance of the larger Dow energy component since Warren Buffett announced his interest in the oil giant. Yet for both Exxon and Chevron, investors are looking for rising energy demand from stronger economies globally to boost both stocks' prospects, potentially opening up new sources of economically viable oil and natural gas for further exploration and production.|Is oil the right market to invest in for 2014?Exxon and Chevron's gains point to the impact that record oil and natural gas production is having on the U.S. and its energy needs. To help you make the most of this opportunity, The Motley Fool is offering a comprehensive look at three energy companies set to soar during this transformation in the energy industry.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/27/will-3m-beat-out-dow-peers-general-electric-and-un.aspx|12/27/2013|0|"General Electric"|0|Will 3M Beat Out Dow Peers General Electric and United Technologies in 2014?|3M (NYSE: MMM) has given its shareholders amazing returns in 2013, with the manufacturing conglomerate posting gains of 53% so far this year, more than doubling the returns of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) . Yet even with all the strong moves it made this year, much of 3M's gains came from investors being willing to pay a higher earnings multiple in anticipation of faster net-income growth in the future. Will 3M deliver on that promise, or will rival conglomerates General Electric (NYSE: GE) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) have a chance to catch up in 2014 and beyond?|3M has taken a lot of strides forward in the past year, with CEO Inge Thulin having gained valuable experience in running the company. Moves to consolidate its acquisitions, including its major buyout of Ceradyne late last year, have started bearing fruit in improving 3M's fundamentals. Nevertheless, looking forward, 3M will have to keep up its pace to justify the confidence that shareholders have expressed in the conglomerate's future. Let's take a closer look at 3M's prospects at beating the Dow, General Electric, and United Technologies in 2014.|As has been the case for several years now, the biggest challenge that 3M has faced has been trying to boost organic growth. Conglomerate peers General Electric and United Technologies have both used outside acquisitions extensively to produce gains in revenue. United Technologies' major buyout of Goodrich helped the conglomerate greatly increase its exposure to the high-growth aerospace industry, helping it focus its business on its best prospects. Similarly, General Electric has made moves to boost its presence in the energy space, including the buyout of oil-services company Lufkin Industries. In that light, 3M's purchase of Ceradyne doesn't seem all that unusual, but it does expose the relative ease of acquiring outside businesses compared to growing sales from already-existing operations.|3M's 2014 performance compared to the Dow will rely on the company's ability to deliver the growth that it has promised and that investors have expected in sending the stock price up so far this year. Competition from business rivals in 3M's most important segments will force the company to work hard to produce even a fraction of the gains it has enjoyed in 2013. But with that effort, 3M could set the stage for longer-term gains not only in 2014 but for future years as well that could put General Electric, United Technologies, and the broader Dow to shame.

At Home Depot, which sells DIY supplies, online sales rose 50 percent to about $600 million in the same period. Walmart expects its global online sales to rise 30 percent to $13 billion next year.|The rates of growth are impressive, but such figures are more easily achieved because they are coming from low bases. E-commerce often still represents a small proportion of total sales: 6 percent at Best Buy, 3 percent at Home Depot and less than 3 percent at Walmart.|For example, many buyers of Home Depot grills and patio furniture go to a store to get the advice of a shop assistant, but buy on their smartphones then and there so they can get home delivery and avoid carrying the items themselves.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/27/innovation-is-the-key-growth-driver-for-these-prem.aspx|12/27/2013|0|"Nike"|0|Nike (NYSE: NKE) has been a great stock for shareholders to hold for the long run. It is also a consistent dividend-paying company. In the past five years, Nike has given investors a total return of 225.60% which beat the S&P 500's total return of 105% during the same period. Shareholders must feel quite happy with Nike recently after its strong second-quarter results beat analysts' expectations. However, Nike shares declined slightly on the market. Is Nike now a better choice for investors than its peers Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA) ?|Innovation drives Nike's operating performanceIn the second quarter, Nike grew its revenue from continuing operations by 8% to $6.4 billion, driven by good growth in every geography and key category. Its net income reached $537 million which was a 3% increase over the same period last year. Earnings per share experienced higher growth of 4%, due to Nike's share buyback activities.|Despite the challenging retail environment, Nike has still delivered a decent operating performance due to its focus on product and performance innovation. In the recent quarter, Nike's innovation came from three main areas: digital initiatives, new advances in apparel, and manufacturing revolution. E-commerce revenue increased by 33%, and Nike believes the digital area will be one of its main long-term growth drivers.|In the second quarter, the next generation of the Nike+ Fuelband, the Fuelband SE, launched. This reinforced Nike Fuelband's goal of becoming the world's leading way to measure all kinds of activities. The company also mentioned that it will keep investing in infrastructure and innovation to drive its digital strategy forward.|Adidas and Under Armour are also very innovative companiesNike's global peer, Adidas, enjoyed revenue growth of 14% due to its ground-breaking product innovations, including Energy Boost and Springblades. Energy Boost, which was developed in partnership with BASF, has thousands of units of compressed, thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPU, material.|Among the three, Under Armour is the most expensive as it is valued at 62 times its trailing earnings. Adidas ranks second with an earnings multiple of 36. Nike is the cheapest one with a P/E ratio of 26.6. Thus, among these three, I like Nike the most because of its global-leading position in the sports industry, lower relative valuation, and decent dividend yield at 1.10%.

The settlements included $16.2 million in fines, along with "at least $59.5 million in customer remediation," most of which has already been paid. The company also said most of the costs associated with the settlements had been booked during previous quarters.|The settlements resulted from regulatory investigations of the cross-selling of credit protection products, which resulted in significant fines to competitors of American Express during, including Capital One (COF), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America(BAC) and Discover Financial Services, (BAC) during 2012.|American Express had agreed in October 2012 to civil fines totaling $27.5 million to settle investigations of "certain aspects" of its U.S. consumer card practices, and set up an $85 million restricted fund for customer refunds.|For investors, the cost of the settlements means nothing, and the timing of the settlements means there's one less negative headline for American Express next year.|Sakhrani continues to rate American Express "outperform," even though the stock has returned 56% this year through Tuesday's close at $88.69. That is quite a performance, even in the midst of a bull market that has seen the S&P 500 rise 29%.|For the first three quarters of 2013, American Express reported a return on average equity (ROE) of 24.3%, which was down from 26.3% a year earlier, but was still a very respectable number. Earnings attributable to common shareholders rose 11% to $3.67 a share for the first three quarters of 2013 from $3.31 a year earlier, reflecting a 5% year-over-year increase in revenue, and also a 5% decrease in the average share count.|American Express repurchased about $3.153 million worth of common shares during the first three quarters of 2013, and said it expected to complete roughly $800 million in additional repurchases during the fourth quarter.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/26/why-frontier-communications-bounced-21-in-2013.aspx|12/26/2013|0|"AT&T"|1|Rural telecommunications company Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR) broke its losing streak in 2013, posting gains of more than 20% after losses in 2011 and 2012 cut more than half of the value from its share price. Even though both Frontier and rival Windstream (NASDAQ: WIN) managed to keep their dividend payouts stable in 2013 -- a feat that CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL) couldn't match after its dividend cut early this year -- Frontier's recent deal with AT&T (NYSE: T) represents a doubling-down in Frontier's bet on the profit potential of the rural telecom market. Let's take a closer look at what happened with Frontier Communications this year and whether its stock will rise in 2014.|Given Frontier's extensive debt, it was surprising to see its deal last week with AT&T to acquire the wireless giant's Connecticut statewide fiber network and wireline business for $2 billion in cash . But investors pushed Frontier shares up 10% on news of the deal, based on the company's assertion the deal would boost Frontier's free cash flow within the first year after its completion. With the resulting improvement in the company's ratio of dividend payouts to free cash flow, shareholders hope not only that the AT&T deal will prevent a future cut in quarterly dividends but potentially even allow an increase at some point in the not-too-distant future.|What's next for Frontier Communications?Even before the AT&T deal, Frontier had started to see the rate at which it was losing residential customers start to slow. That points to the potential success of Frontier's strategy to get exiting landline customers to take on broadband and other services instead. With new AT&T customers coming on board, Frontier will have to duplicate its past success in retaining their business.|For Frontier to continue rising, it needs to work on improving its overall strategy toward retaining residential and business customers. During 2014, watch closely at the company's efforts to sell more services to its existing customers both in established markets and in the newly acquired Connecticut market once the AT&T deal goes through. Frontier needs to see its turnaround continue and for revenue to hit bottom in order to convince shareholders its rebound is for real.
http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/12/26/dividends-the-three-most-generous-companies.aspx|12/26/2013|0|"AT&T"|0|Generous Ma BellRanked No. 3 within the S&P 500 is the telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) , which paid out $2.4 billion in the third quarter and just announced a modest (and some would say disappointing) 2% increase in the dividend, which has been bumped up each year since 1985. The average annual increase had been 4.8%.|The small increase will not have been a surprise if you looked into the numbers. AT&T already pays out 123% of its earnings (which are projected to grow slowly next year), so there wasn't a lot of room to maneuver. And with a relatively elevated long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 80%, the company probably doesn't want to borrow to return more cash to shareholders.|AT&T might need to use excess cash and to borrow to fund future expansion in wireless and grow revenue. It is considering buying the European operations of Vodafone, which could set the company back as much as $175 billion. It is also in the process of selling off some assets, like its wired operations in Connecticut, to generate cash.|So investors looking for dividend growth from AT&T might need to look elsewhere, at least in the short term.|Meanwhile, AT&T pays out a far great portion of its earnings than the average S&P 500 constituent, so if you seek dividend growth, you may want to look elsewhere.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/26/the-end-of-an-era-what-it-means-for-delta-air-line.aspx|12/26/2013|0|"Boeing"|4|The airline also saw an opportunity to add some Boeing 717 aircraft to its fleet, and began leasing 88 of the aircraft from Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) . Southwest came into ownership of the planes after it acquired AirTran Airways in a 2011 merger; however, Southwest decided to maintain its pure Boeing 737 fleet by leasing the 717s to Delta. As an extra sweetener to Delta, Southwest paid $100 million to convert the planes to Delta's standards. Although the latest types of aircraft would still edge out the 717 in lower operational costs, the 717s are still an improvement in efficiency for Delta, because they will replace less economical small jets in Delta's fleet.|Even when it comes to new aircraft, Delta is still choosing the less expensive options. Over the next few years, Delta will be taking delivery of 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft rather than opting for Boeing's latest 737 iteration, the 737 MAX.|United Continental (NYSE: UAL) has launched a major push for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, as it became the North American launch customer and ordered 65 Dreamliners of varying types. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) has built its new image around having a modern fleet, and went about it by placing the largest order in aircraft history in 2011. Totaling 460 planes split between Boeing and Airbus, the order was still allowed to continue despite the airline's bankruptcy filing in November of that year. Since then, the newly merged airline has started taking delivery of the first of the planes, and has placed another order for 90 regional jets split between Embraer SA, and Bombardier.

Photo credit: Boeing.|Inside the Dow Jones, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks to finish 2013 as the composite's best performing stock -- up more than 80% for the year. The company's performance has been surging as it continues to develop innovative airplanes for cash-strapped airlines. It's 787 Dreamliner, 737 MAX, and 777X all offer vastly improved fuel economy and have been selling very well -- contributing greatly to Boeing's massive $415 billion order backlog, which doesn't even include nearly $100 billion in orders for the 777X from November's Dubai Airshow. In addition, Boeing delivered its very first 747-8 with performance-improved engines last week, marking a milestone for its 747 program.|Boeing management was confident enough in the company's bright future to hike its dividend 50%, as well as authorizing $10 billion in share repurchases over the next two to three years. With its airplanes selling extremely well, investors will look at one factor as we head into 2014: the location of 777X production.|In the latest twist to labor negotiations between Boeing and its machinists in Everett, Wash., where the 777 airplane is produced, the union will vote again on Jan. 3 to approve or reject a contract extension. The latest offer would replace workers' pension-style retirement fund with a contribution, or 401(k)- style, program. That isn't the only change, but it's the variable that has conjured the most controversy. If the offer is accepted, Boeing would guarantee 777X production at the Everett plant, making Washington state the winner in a heated nationwide competition to get those jobs.|Settling this situation would remove one of the biggest uncertainties facing Boeing and its investors. After budget overruns, production delays, and multiple other headaches revolving around the 787 Dreamliner, many investors would like to avoid similar problems that could arise if Boeing moves its 777X production outside of Washington state. Look for Boeing management to make its decision and remove the uncertainty, one way or another, early in 2014.

Shares are down almost 15% since late October, driven by industry bellwether Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) weak guidance in November and Ciena's own fourth-quarter earnings "debacle" earlier this month.|However, recent industry trends haven't been favorable for Ciena, especially after networking giant Cisco reduced its revenue growth guidance. Cisco expects its top line to grow at 3% to 6% per year over the next three to five years, down from an earlier forecast of 5% to 7%. This led to fears of a slowdown in its telecom and network spending.|However, the problem at Cisco seems to be company-centric. Cisco is facing weakness in its emerging markets due to the recent surveillance allegations.

As such, this should be good news for Ciena since it is a Cisco competitor and is finding traction in the emerging markets.

Peer Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) is trying to play catch up, having jumped 15% this month alone, but the stock is still closing the year a notch below DuPont with 41% returns.|So, did DuPont deliver solid growth on its top and bottom lines this year that peers couldn't match up? Not quite. In fact, the company is set to close the financial year on a dour note. Investors are simply optimistic about DuPont's prospects, backed by some major business decisions that it took in 2013.|DuPont's truce with Monsanto over a long-pending legal battle, and its decision to divest its core titanium dioxide pigment (TiO2) business soon after Huntsman Chemical made a similar announcement were the most notable developments. Encouraged by those business decisions, analysts expect DuPont's earnings to grow 13% in 2014. But will the company's moves really pay off and boost share prices in 2014, or have investors jumped the gun? Let's find out.|The big opportunity DuPont's agriculture business was the strongest this year, contributing 35% and 48% to its total sales and operating income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013. Seed sales grew 11% during the period, helping DuPont gain more than a percentage point share in the critical U.S. corn market. This year DuPont also acquired majority stake in one of South Africa's leading seed companies, Pannar Seed, thereby expanding its global presence.|But the most significant development of 2013 was the cross-licensing agreement that DuPont struck with Monsanto. In return for an annual royalty totaling $802 million to be paid for four years beginning 2014, and another annual payment of $950 million starting 2018, DuPont will be able to offer Monsanto's soybeans trait, including the popular Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans, from next year. While the financial implication is big, access to the world's largest seed company's technologies certainly has its advantages. The deal has come at an opportune time. With a record corn harvest this year sending corn prices to multiyear low, farmers in the U.S. gear up to plant more soybeans in 2014.|Backed by these additional opportunities, DuPont's agriculture business should continue to perform well next year. Meanwhile, if the TiO2 markets revive, DuPont's 2014 performance graph could end up looking way better than this year's.|Will this idea work?Improving sales volumes in recent months signal a reviving Tio2 market. TiO2 was a high-margin product until late 2012 when a supply glut sent pigment prices tumbling. After a long lull, both DuPont and Huntsman Chemical reported 25% and 20% higher year-over-year TiO2 sales volumes, respectively, during their third quarter. That's encouraging news for DuPont going into 2014.|But all eyes will be on the progress of DuPont's planned TiO2 segment spin-off. The business, which generated $7.2 billion in revenue in 2012 and contributed 21% to the company's total revenue, will be spun off into a separate public company. Given the volatile and unpredictable nature of the TiO2 markets, DuPont expects the separation to unlock greater value for its shareholders. With industry experts remaining less hopeful about the TiO2 business over the long run, and Huntsman also opting to separate its pigment division, DuPont could be headed the right way.|At the same time, DuPont is well established as the world's largest TiO2 producer, while it still has a long way to go in the field of agriculture. Competition from Monsanto is intense, and there's the threat of getting mired in controversies over genetically modified organism foods. So separating the TiO2 business doesn't mean that it'll be a smooth ride from here. With DuPont planning to complete the transaction within the next 18 months, investors should expect significant progress and regular updates in 2014.|Solar power DuPont's electronics and communications division should also improve in 2014. Revenue from the business fell 8% through September this year even as Dow Chemical reported 2% improvement in sales from its electronics and functional materials business during the period. While dominance in the smartphone and tablet material market is boosting Dow Chemical's revenue, DuPont's focus on photovoltaic and solar materials hasn't helped much. But with China planning to install 12 gigawatts of PV power next year, DuPont's prospects look better.|Foolish takeaway With growth catalysts in place, DuPont should perform well in 2014. And if the company can capitalize on the Monsanto soybean opportunity, and completes the TiO2 transaction ahead of schedule, the stock could head even higher. DuPont investors can look forward to an eventful and profitable 2014.|DuPont looks great, but this particular stock could land you with earth-shattering returnsImagine a company that rents a very specific and valuable piece of machinery for $41,000... per hour (that's almost as much as the average American makes in a year!).

An exclusive, brand-new Motley Fool report reveals the company we're calling OPEC's Worst Nightmare. Just click HERE to uncover the name of this industry-leading stock... and join Buffett in his quest for a veritable LANDSLIDE of profits!|In short, DuPont Management is tossing away DuPont's supreme position in TIO2, where it reigns as the the leader in TIO2 technology and largest producer in the world to concentrate nearly exclusively on its crown jewel, DuPont AG & NUT. Unfortunately, DuPont plays second fiddle on the world stage to Monsanto in seeds, to Syngenta in crop protection and to Novozymes in enzymes and food additives.|Investors need to ask themselves whether they would be better off investing in Monsanto, the true biotech leader and superior innovator in seeds, or the copycat, DuPont, which pays out hundreds of $millions in license fees yearly to Monsanto in order to embed DuPont Pioneer's otherwise inferior seeds with Monsanto's GM traits.|The long-term trajectory of DuPont's stock has been down over the course of the 21st century, after setting a peak of 84 and change over 15 years ago in May of 1998. For years, DuPont's PR-driven leaders have been tenaciously embracing a business model of SHRINKAGE equals GROWTH, promising growth and gains, but delivering little. Notwithstanding the personal heckling of hostile fans and supporters of DuPont Management, the undersigned will continue to share thoughts and opinions on this equity with fellow investors.|DuPont Management commands a veritable army of PR agents, lobbyists, lawyers, IMAGE consultants and trade association operatives to propagandise and put forth public relations puffery.

It's true that CEO Jamie Dimon has faced a barrage of scandals recently, yet somehow, both his firm and his reputation remain relatively untarnished in the echo-chamber of Wall Street. I find that curious. Here's why.|Citigroup (NYSE: C) became the largest firm in the business, its market cap once peaking at $277 billion in late 2006. Of course, Dimon never got the chance to bear the fruits of his labor because Mr. Weill fired him soon after the merger. Jamie Dimon is no quitter, however. He went over to JP Morgan and steered the company through the 2008 economic collapse using the same wits and banking philosophy that transformed an entire industry just one decade before. However, with all credit to their ingenuity, because it's been a successful strategy at creating shareholder value, noticeably absent in Weill and Dimon's value proposition is the notion of social costs. Their calculus ignores the crucial role that banks play in the overall economy, and it's an oversight that continually haunts our financial system|Those stakeholders are not happy, either. Outside of Wall Street's bubble, populist anger against JPMorgan remains widespread. This is thanks in part to alleged mortgage violations, the London Whale fiasco, and the questionable hiring of a Chinese minister's daughter (just to name a few of the company's issues!). The company's disastrous Twitter outreach attempt proved how out of touch these executives can be.|So what?Does any of that even matter? I mean, year to date, JPMorgan's share price is up an impressive 29% despite some of the highest litigation costs in the industry. An additional $4 billion was set aside for legal expenses this quarter, bringing the total to over $30 billion in just three years. While shareholders might think the slate is being wiped clean, it's obvious Mr. Dimon's leadership has had some costs.|Don't get me wrong. I understand why his supporters like him. By all accounts, he's a brilliant guy, he steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis, he communicates well, and he has a sense of humor. I've got nothing against him personally. Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns were purchased under his watch, though, moving their liabilities into his column. More importantly, his philosophy of banking, the one that prizes a profit over stability... it has proven unsustainable. If you're not a fan of stock market crashes, stop treating banks like growth stocks. It only feeds the problem.

The company's broader portfolio has a 42% share of the U.S. carbonated- soft-drink market, a 34% share of U.S. liquid-refreshment-beverages market, and a similar lead in international markets.|Having a dominant market share confers significant advantages to Coca-Cola, Altria, and Philip Morris International. For soft drinks and cigarettes alike, sales are dependent on effective advertising and customer loyalty. All three companies are able to outspend competitors on advertising because of superior scale.|Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's customers demonstrate exceptional brand loyalty -- people are either Coke drinkers or Pepsi drinkers but rarely both. Consumers are literally addicted to cigarettes and show brand loyalty similar to that of Coke drinkers.|The scale advantages and customer loyalty give Coca-Cola, Altria, and Philip Morris International tremendous pricing power, as evidenced in their stable gross margins.|In addition to pricing power, Coca-Cola, Altria, and Philip Morris International have significant economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution. Each company spreads fixed costs across a greater number of products sold than its rivals are able, thus enabling them to earn higher operating profits.|Bottom lineCoca-Cola, Altria, and Philip Morris International own leading brands that command premium prices and have unmatched distribution capabilities.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/26/wellpoint-can-new-leadership-and-a-big-acquisition.aspx|12/26/2013|0|"UnitedHealth Group"|0|The uncertainties created by the Affordable Care Act (the ACA or "Obamacare") have affected all of the players in the space, leading to a drive toward consolidation and scale through acquisitions for AetnaInc. (NYSE: AET) , Cigna Corporation (NYSE: CI) , and WellPoint, (NYSE: WLP) . But not all of WellPoint's problems can be blamed on the ACA. WellPoint struggled operationally under the tenure of now-former CEO Angela Braly and finds itself in need of self-repair at a time when others like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) can use their cash flow to fund acquisitions outside of the U.S. regulated managed care space.|While WellPoint has been the laggard of the "big four" over the past two and five years, it is not as though the company's performance has been disastrous. UnitedHealth is up about 45% over the last two years and Aetna is up about 55%, while WellPoint's shares have risen about 35%. WellPoint still has meaningful scope to tighten up its operations and drive synergies from its large acquisition of Amerigroup, and while the ACA has added a lot of unknowns to the model, the company's conservatism in these early days is likely to mitigate that risk. I don't see quite the same potential in WellPoint shares as I do from UnitedHealth, but there's still enough here to be worth some consideration.|Insurance companies are in the business of pricing risk, but they don't really like uncertainty. Unfortunately, there has been uncertainty in spades in this initial period of the ACA. Like UnitedHealth, WellPoint is going to see some benefits from the one year extension on plans that would otherwise have been canceled, but it's not really a significant driver of results.|Where WellPoint could see more benefit is in its Medicaid business. Post-Amerigroup, WellPoint administers Medicaid plans for more than 4 million people across 19 states, and thus far the enrollment process for insurance under the ACA has led to a 15% jump in Medicaid applications as people who didn't realize they were eligible for Medicaid are informed that they may be. As WellPoint has about 12% share of the Medicaid market (versus 10% for UnitedHealth and less than 5% for Aetna), that's a potentially meaningful revenue opportunity.|The impact on WellPoint's individual policy business has yet to play out. Unlike UnitedHealth, Cigna, or Aetna, WellPoint has been relatively bold in participating in exchanges as it is participating in part to maintain its Blue Cross Blue Shield franchise in those 14 states where it holds a license. WellPoint has been fairly conservative with its pricing (at least relative to group premiums and past individual policies), but nobody yet knows what the health care utilization and medical loss ratios will look like. Government policies including non-profit reinsurance entities will help mitigate the risk of outsized claims, but that is not the same as guaranteeing any particular level of profitability.|The net result? While Aetna and UnitedHealth delivered roughly 2% to 3% annual EBIT growth over the past six years and Cigna grew over 5%, WellPoint saw profits decline almost 6% a year.|As time goes on and managed care companies dial in their pricing and expectations for individual plans under the ACA, I expect attention to focus back to ancillary growth opportunities. While WellPoint could look to challenge Cigna more in the commercial self-insured fee market, I would hope that the company would turn instead to opportunities in health care information technology. UnitedHealth has already established a strong presence here, but I think there's room for WellPoint to get involved and I think it's an opportunity with better risk-reward trade-offs than acquisitions like 1-800 Contacts.|I value managed care companies with a two-part methodology that uses a discounted cash flow model and an excess returns model. Provided that WellPoint can maintain a 10% return on equity (against a trailing three-year average of over 11%), a fair value in the mid-$90s is entirely reasonable. If the synergies with Amerigroup and/or operational improvements really come through and that long-term ROE can rise to 12.5%, the target jumps to well over $100. With a cash flow model, a long-term estimate of 7% FCF growth (higher than UnitedHealth, mostly to account for the lower starting point of WellPoint after its half-decade of underperformance) points to a fair value of just about $100 today.|WellPoint does not appear to be as cheap as UnitedHealth by either of my favored methodologies, which may be a little surprising given UnitedHealth's much higher price/book and EV/EBITDA multiples. That's where the differences in margin structure, cash flow generation, and returns on equity or capital come into play. Although I think UnitedHealth may be the safer opportunity, I wouldn't rule out the possibility that WellPoint could outperform expectations and generate good returns even after a strong 2013.

IBM's problems and Boeing's success seem to be the opposite of each other: While IBM failed to innovate and change, that's all Boeing seemed to do this year.|Boeing rolled out hot new products that its customers seemed to find irresistible -- from the 787 Dreamliner with its lighter weight body and battery-powered mechanical parts to help reduce weight and fuel costs, to the 737 Max, to the 777X, which is expected to be the most fuel-efficient plane ever built and not even scheduled to be delivered until 2020. The company just couldn't stop selling airplanes.|Investing is all about being able to accurately predict a company's revenues and earnings down the road, and investors who are good at it do pretty well for themselves. When a company pre-sells items, those predictions become less of a guess and more of just figuring out when the products will be delivered. That's where Boeing sits, with a current backlog of $415.1 billion in plane sales and with those aircraft slated to be delivered years into the future. The only guess becomes whether Boeing will be able to keep up with its scheduled delivery dates.|Furthermore, only $70 billion of Boeing's backlog comes from the defense and aerospace industries, while $345 billion lies with the 4,800 commercial aircraft the company needs to make. That mix, combined with its other revenue streams, helped Boeing weather the government shutdown rather unharmed this year, while its peers struggled a bit more.|But the most impressive thing about Boeing in 2013 was that it managed to do well even in spite of the problems it had with its 787 Dreamliner. The plane made plenty of headlines with its batteries that caught fire, but once the regulators approved a solution and confirmed that the 787 was safe to fly, it seemed that was the sign investors wanted to see. The next generation of aircraft had finally arrived, and Boeing's shares flew higher and never looked back.|Moving forward, investors should continue to be optimistic about Boeing's prospects, but they shouldn't expect a repeat performance of 2013. Now that the risk associated with the Dreamliner isn't hanging over the company going into 2014, the stock will have one less catalyst helping it move higher. But shares could experience a similar pop in 2020, when the 777Xs are first delivered. Stay tuned, long-term investors.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/25/is-procter-gamble-on-track.aspx|12/25/2013|0|"Procter & Gamble" OR "Procter And Gamble"|0|Is Procter & Gamble on Track?|As the global economy kept on facing headwinds, the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) giants, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) and Unilever (NYSE: UL) didn't do a great job this year. The Ex-CEO of Procter & Gamble, Bob McDonald, was under constant criticism as the company's growth struggled at home and abroad. In such frustrating times, the board decided to call back their celebrated former CEO, A. G. Lafley, to rekindle the growth. Will Lafley be able to deliver according to the investors' expectations? Let's have a look at P&G in detail.|First quarter analysisProcter & Gamble's first-quarter report shows that its vigorous marketing strategies and increased product innovations are finally paying off. The company earned $1.04 per share in the first quarter of 2014, representing an 8% increase from the comparable quarter of the previous year. Net sales amounted to $21.21 billion, an increase of 2% from the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had estimated net sales to be $20.05 billion.|According to Lafley, the new restructuring (which will be done in the middle of next year) will also facilitate more product innovation at the company. In the past, product innovation was always a central theme at Procter & Gamble. Recently, the company earned the honor of being on the Top 100 Global Innovators' list developed by Thomson Reuters. A remarkable 6% year-over-year growth in the Baby, Feminine, and Family Care segment is a direct result of increased product innovation.|Beauty and personal care analysts at CosmeticsDesign.com believe that the "multifunctional" products will lead the future growth instead of typical "anti-aging" products as consumers want to save up on time and money. Furthermore, the consumers are demanding "free from" and "natural products". As Procter & Gamble focuses on more natural and multifunctional products, the company's CFO Jon Moeller hinted at major innovations in beauty business that will come out at the end of this year. The beauty care segment saw a sluggish growth of 1% during this quarter, but with the company rolling out new products this year this figure is bound to go up.|The emerging markets have grown to become one of the biggest markets for Procter and Gamble. In 2013, P&G's 39% net sales came from the developing markets, indicating the growth potential of the region. To gain further from the burgeoning middle class with higher disposable incomes, the company plans to capitalize more on these markets. As a result, the emerging markets will continue to contribute toward the company's growth in the future.|FundamentalsProcter and Gamble has a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3 as compared to the industry average of 18.9. Its price-to-book stands at 3.47, which is lowest among its competitors; this supports my belief that it's an excellent value at this stage.|Free cash flow per share for Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive are 1.31, 0.71, and 1.51, respectively. The free cash flow for Procter & Gamble is much higher than Unilever, but it's lower than Colgate-Palmolive. On closer inspection, though, we see that Colgate-Palmolive has financed much of its cash through borrowing as its debt to equity ratio is 263 as compared to 27 at Procter & Gamble. This shows that P&G is generating a lot of cash through its strong operating activities.|Final wordsI strongly believe that Procter & Gamble will perform well in the future as it has restructured itself for increased efficiency. The company has given a rosy outlook for the rest of the fiscal year and seems to be on track for delivering results. Its financial outlook is strong, and the company's stock will definitely appreciate as I believe it is undervalued right now. Product innovation will act as catalyst for increased profitability.

It is a distant third in the cola wars, with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) combining for a 70% share of the market compared to Dr Pepper Snapple's 17% share. However, the latter's recent initiatives may enable it to close the gap in 2014.|Dr Pepper Snapple is gaining on Coca-Cola and PepsiCoCarbonated soft drinks, or CSDs, have been linked to obesity and other unhealthy conditions. At issue is the copious amount of sugar and artificial sweeteners found in the drinks. This has resulted in weak CSD sales volume in 2013 and an uncertain future for the industry in the United States.|PepsiCo, on the other hand, has struggled to retain its market share amid a challenging environment; its share of the CSD market fell from 31.1% in 2007 to 28.1% in 2012. Coca-Cola also lost market share over this period, falling from 42.8% to 42% according to Beverage Digest. Meanwhile, Dr Pepper Snapple's market share grew from 15% in 2007 to 16.8% in 2012, although the bulk of those gains came in 2009.|Latin America and beyond present long-term growth opportunityCoca-Cola and PepsiCo own global brands with worldwide distribution systems. Dr Pepper Snapple, on the other hand, has only dipped its toe into international waters. The company's Latin America segment represented just 7.6% of its overall sales through the first three quarters of 2013, but that was up from 6.9% in 2012.|Despite the low returns on capital, Dr Pepper Snapple's determination to build its own bottling and distribution system will help wean the company off of third-party distribution systems, namely those of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The two soft drink giants account for half of Dr Pepper Snapple's net sales in the beverage concentrates segment, or about 10% of its total sales. The company also partners with local entrepreneurs that build the system outside of the company, reducing Dr Pepper Snapple's capital outlay.|Regardless of how Dr Pepper Snapple chooses to expand, its brands have global potential similar to those of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, so it has a long runway for growth beyond its current markets.|Bottom lineDr Pepper Snapple is doing well in a poor environment. It will always play third wheel to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but product innovation, cost reductions, and future growth put the company on a path to narrow the gap.

However, the financial confidence of consumers also plays a vital role in the economy's general health. A tracking index can help investors decide when to invest in consumer-staples retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Family Dollar (NYSE: FDO) or higher-end sellers such as Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) or Macy's (NYSE: M) . .|Investment plays As the indicator's name would suggest, the clearest path to benefiting from sentiment growth is to invest in consumer goods. Weak growth points toward investing in consumer staples and stores with lower-priced products, such as Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Continued strengthening means investors can move further into discretionary retailers such as Macy's or Tiffany & Co.|However, as the chart shows, share prices of these companies won't mirror the indicator in the same way that happens with some other indicators, such as housing starts and builder stocks. Wal-Mart moves most closely to the indicator because its customer base tends to have the least consumer confidence in general so economic changes hit particularly hard. When Wal-Mart customers lose confidence, as happened during the recession, Family Dollar stands to benefit.

The two are merely payment-processing companies. On the other hand, American Express and Discover Financial Services are both payment processors and lenders. Although this attribute helps them double-dip in profits, it also exposes them to the considerable risk of bad debt write-offs. This is especially important if economic growth continues to be tepid, and consumers default on their debt payments. Visa and MasterCard have essentially no bad debt exposure, and thus enjoy freedom to grow with minimal limitations.|American Express and DiscoverVisa and MasterCard engage multiple organizations, whereas American Express and Discover are more akin to one-stop shops. They issue their own cards, authorize consumer purchases, and then settle with both merchants and consumers.|American Express was the first company to issue its customers a plastic card. In 1987, the firm introduced revolving payments. The firm generally charges merchants a higher fee than the other three, and this may account for its smaller global reach than Visa and MasterCard. The company says that its cards are accepted in 130 countries worldwide.|Discover Financial Services was introduced into the scene by big box retailer Sears Holdings in 1985 in its efforts to expand into the financial services industry. The company was later sold to Dean Witter, which in turn was acquired by Morgan Stanley. The firm's cards are accepted at 4 million locations worldwide, considerably less than the number of locations that accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.|The considerable credit exposure of American Express and Discover makes these two riskier investments than either Visa or MasterCard.

Commercial aerospace demand is soaring, but will defense budget cuts crimp Boeing's stock growth in 2014?|Boeing's new boomBoeing certainly has a rosy outlook for the future of the commercial airline market. The company projected in its most recet quarterly report that airline passenger and cargo traffic will pick up by 5% annually. Boeing estimated in its most recent market outlook that airplane demand could hit up to $4.8 trillion in the years between 2012 and 2032 -- a great sign for this aerospace leader in the long term. But how will that all play out in 2014?|The improving economy should help push aerospace demand and traffic, Boeing notes. With the U.S. economy having recovered enough for the Federal Reserve to announce a tapering of quantitative easing and China focusing on sustainable long-term growth, the world's two largest economies seem to be on strong economic paths for the years ahead. Boeing has done a masterful job racking up new orders and growing its commercial backlog this year -- the firm's commercial contractual backlog jumped 8.5% between the end of last year and the first nine months of 2013 -- and higher air traffic next year should only see more new orders and a growing backlog for Boeing.|Taking a look at Boeing's individual aircraft, 2014 should be a big year for the 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft has been on a roll since Boeing first took orders for its flagship plane: The 787 racked up its 1,000th order in November after nine years on the market -- considerably less time than its predecessor, the 777, took to reach that mark. With the fleet-grounding drama that slammed the 787's reputation this year now in the past, expect the recent surge in demand for the 787 to continue into the new year.|Despite the 787's growing momentum, it will likely be the reliable 737 line of aircraft that powers Boeing's new year -- and beyond. The 737 MAX has been a solid contributor to Boeing's cash machine lately. Boeing expects about 70% of new aircraft deliveries between 2012 and 2032 to be single-aisle aircraft, given the rise of new markets like China and the ascent of budget airlines. And, as one of Boeing's top products, the 737 should maintain its dominance in that market.|Budget restraints ease up, but competition stiffensThe forecast looks sunny for Boeing's commercial aerospace division, but how can the company's defense and space systems branch hold up in 2014?|The Pentagon will still have to confront daunting budget cuts in its future, but it won a reprieve when Washington approved a budget deal this month that will ease sequestration's effects in the new year. The resulting plan will allow about $500 billion in budget authority for the Department of Defense next year. That won't help Boeing dramatically -- much of the Pentagon's spending outlays in 2014 are already locked in, and the Department of Defense's budget authority heavily influences future spending and outlays. However, it's a sign that Boeing will be able to count on more flexibility from the Pentagon than it could have under original budget cuts.|Still, Boeing's defense and space segment has become a smaller chunk of its total business throughout 2013, and that's a trend that should continue in 2013, given the growth of the commercial airline market. Boeing's defense and space contractual backlog shrank by nearly 10% from the end of last year through the first nine months of 2013, and revenue hasn't grown anywhere near as quickly as commercial revenue. Expect more sluggishness out of this segment in 2014, but don't expect that to hinder Boeing's overall performance too much.|Boeing investors also need to keep a close eye on the competition. Lockheed-Martin (NYSE: LMT) is Boeing's closest competitor in the defense segment, and it won a big victory over Boeing in November when South Korea's military brass announced that it would purchase Lockheed's F-35 fighter for its air forces -- even after Boeing's own F-15 was the only craft to meet cost criteria in a recent contest worth up to $7.7 billion. The F-35 is gaining steam despite its cost overruns and other problems, and Lockheed is pushing hard to command an increasing share of the Pentagon's budget.|No turbulence expected in 2014Despite tough competition and budget cuts in the defense sector, Boeing looks set to fly still higher in 2014. Boeing might not repeat the ridiculous 77% year-to-date gains it has pulled down in 2013, but have no fear: There are clear skies ahead for this company.|Will your portfolio cruise in 2014?Boeing and the market stormed out to huge gains across 2013, leaving investors on the sidelines burned.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/24/is-mcdonalds-losing-touch-with-its-customers.aspx|12/24/2013|0|"McDonald's Corp"|0|In the name of research and journalism, I just had to go into a McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and try the Mighty Wings. Walking in with already low expectations, there was a chance of a pleasant surprise. While it's absolutely true that the experience was anecdotal, there was something in particular that exists chainwide that may make you wonder if McDonald's has lost its touch with its customers.|5000 tons It's been reported that McDonald's is sitting on 10 million pounds of frozen leftover Mighty Wings from an original batch of 50 million. The franchisees have been complaining that the wings are too expensive, among other things, especially when they have a dollar menu on the board right next to the wings.|I mean, seriously? I'll live without my blue cheese, but McDonald's lost millions and millions of dollars' worth of sales by not offering one of the most basic and popular condiments that normally accompanies any type of spicy wings. With "everybody" asking for blue cheese, McDonald's management should have been proactive and had the condiment already available.|It's not even about the Mighty Wings. The lack of blue cheese isn't the problem. It's a symptom. If management is so blind that it couldn't see that "everybody" would ask for such a basic item, it begs the question: Just how out of touch with consumers is McDonald's?|No wonder McDonald's sales have been sliding. In the third quarter when the company launched the Mighty Wings, U.S. same-store sales only gained 0.7%. This occurred while McDonald's offered its popular Monopoly game promotion which always spikes sales. In October, same-store sales were only up 0.2%. Then in November, they slipped down 0.8%.|Competitors Jack in the Box and SonicIt's easy for McDonald's to simply blame the economy, but not all fast food chains are suffering. Take Jack in the Box (NASDAQ: JACK) for example. Not only did Jack in the Box's earnings blow up 26% last quarter, its sales have gotten stronger ever since then. CEO Linda Lang pointed out that in the last six weeks of the quarter, its sales accelerated higher each week.|Jack in the Box saw its sales continue to accelerate after the quarter ended for at least the next seven weeks up to the last conference call. For the current quarter, Jack in the Box expects a 1.5% to 2.5% increase in same-store sales. The chain continues to grow in the same economy where McDonald's is starting to shrink. Jack in the Box credited the success in part to increased breakfast and late-night menu sales. The company figured out what the customer wanted and it delivered it, instead of ordering 50 million pounds of expensive wings and hoping customers would just eat them as they were.|Meanwhile, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ: WEN) is also showing McDonald's how to make customers happy. In its last quarter, Wendy's reported a same-store sales gain of 3.2%, a level it seems like McDonald's can only dream about at this point. The Wendy's Company credits its success in part to the launches of the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger and the October Pretzel Pub Chicken sandwich. Both sound kind of delicious, don't you think? As a bonus -- they both have cool-sounding names compared with "Mighty Wings" which reminds me of "Mighty Mouse," and the last thing you want to be thinking of when you visit a restaurant is rodents.|Foolish final thoughts If you thought the Mighty Wings were bad, watch out for the upcoming promotional discount on the leftover 10 million pounds of wings, possibly covered in freezer burn. The seemingly downhill direction McDonald's is going is more than a little worrisome. Fools may want to consider sitting McDonald's out for now until it figures out who its customers are again and what they want. How will you know when that happens? Ask the kid behind the register at your local restaurant. He seems to know more than the out-of-touch executives.|The kids behind the counter certainly do know more than McDonald's executives. The vast majority of decision makers at the top of McDonald's Corp. have no real restaurant experience and rely on "experts", focus groups, and marketing people to tell them what McDonald's customers want.

With continued brand strength and traditionally tumultuous geographic markets beginning to stabilize for the sneaker/apparel giant, Nike should remain a viable play on global growth going forward.|Solid earnings Shares of Nike fell slightly the day after the company reported earnings as revenue came in just below the consensus analyst estimate. Nike reported revenue of $6.43 billion for the second quarter, which fell short of the average analyst estimate of $6.44 billion. However, Nike's reported revenue still represented growth of 7.88% from 2012's comparable quarter.|However, the company did beat the average earnings per share estimate. Nike posted diluted earnings of $0.59, which beat the consensus estimate of $0.58 and represented growth of 4% on a year-over-year basis.|The slight revenue miss was likely a reason that shares of Nike slipped over 1% the following day. However, Nike is still up an impressive 50% in 2013 alone.|Powerful brand A key takeaway from management's conference call was the incredible strength of the Nike brand. President of Nike Brand Trevor Edwards explained, "On a constant dollar basis, the Nike brand was up 9% for the quarter with growth across all key categories, product types and geographies."|The brand is growing especially well via direct-to-consumer platforms. Nike's DTC business increased revenue 19% in the quarter, driven primarily by new store openings and continued strength in the company's online businesses. Standouts for the brand include the basketball and soccer categories.|On the basketball front, Nike is keeping its foot on the throttle as it is set to deliver a new sneaker from Kobe Bryant called the Kobe 9 "Masterpiece," which follows on the heels of successful sneaker launches such as Kevin Durant's KD 6, Lebron James' Lebron 11, and Chris Pau's CP 3.7. Additionally, the popular Jordan brand continues to perform well.|On the soccer front, Nike is experiencing a ramp up in business due to the impending World Cup, which is now just six months away. Trevor Edwards explained, "Above all else, the World Cup lets Nike showcase our game-changing product innovations on the global stage."|To capitalize on the global stage that the World Cup provides, Nike has launched team kits for the soccer clubs of France and Brazil in addition to new products like the Hypervenom boot.|The most important takeaway here is that Nike is successfully making the most of its prominent industry positioning. This is demonstrated perfectly in the sports of basketball and soccer, where Nike is increasing brand awareness by fostering relationships with high-profile athletes and teams. Nike is in a unique position in this regard, as smaller competitors like Under Armour (NYSE: UA) and even Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) simply can't keep pace with the sports juggernaut on a global scale.|Improving markets Another important takeaway from Nike's recent report is that key markets like China are beginning to stabilize. Revenue growth in China increased 5% in the quarter, driven primarily by management's direct approach to enhance efficiency. The company is now targeting consumers more specifically and this has led to a 20% increase in direct-to-consumer sales in the second quarter.|Strong growth Despite being a much larger company than its competitors, with a market capitalization of $68.8 billion compared to Under Armour's $9.09 billion and Adidas' $25.8 billion, Nike is still growing relatively well. The following is a breakdown of the company's projected growth rates for its next fiscal year, which ends in May 2015, compared to growth expectations for Under Armour and Adidas in 2014:|Nike|Not surprisingly, the smallest company, Under Armour, is projected to lead its competitors in regard to both revenue and earnings-per-share growth going forward. However, Nike is projected to lead Adidas in revenue growth and it is not too far behind both listed competitors in terms of EPS growth.|DominationDominant is the word I would use to describe Nike's global positioning in the athletic footwear/apparel market. The company's ability to innovate is impressive, even after decades of growth. However, it is Nike's strong brand recognition and the relationships the company continues to forge with popular athletes and teams around the world that ensure global competitors like Under Armour and Adidas will remain a step behind for the foreseeable future.

The unfortunate situation has created a lot of bad press for the retailer. A concern is that it will hurt the company's brand in the long term, which is dangerous with powerful competitors like Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) lurking about.|Who stands to benefit?Even without the recent security disaster, Target has struggled to perform well this year. This is despite the fact that Bloomberg reported earlier in the year large rival Wal-Mart was perhaps getting too big to properly focus on consumers, as many of the company's stores remained understaffed and cluttered.|Smaller companies like Target and Costco were supposedly picking up some of Wal-Mart's business, as they could remain dedicated to consumers through a smaller and more direct focus. However, only Costco seems to have capitalized.|The following is a breakdown of Target's projected growth for 2013 and 2014 compared to that of Costco and Wal-Mart:|Wal-Mart|Costco seems to indeed be benefiting from its ability to engage customers more directly and appears poised to end the year with solid revenue and EPS growth. However, Wal-Mart is still growing well considering it is currently the largest retailer in the world.|In a year in which Target has struggled to grow at all, a massive security breach and loss of consumer confidence is an unfortunate and untimely event. It stands to reason that both Costco and Wal-Mart, which were already outperforming Target in 2013, will benefit from the company's recent stumble in the short term, especially during the busy holiday-shopping season.|Is there opportunity?Savvy investors will always look for opportunity amid a major bad news event. The plunge in Target's share price has knocked the company's valuation down to Wal-Mart's level; both companies' forward P/E ratios are now 13.5.|However, Target is not projected to grow much better than Wal-Mart in 2014 and therefore does not deserve much of a premium. Additionally, the two companies' dividend yields are relatively comparable. On the other hand, Costco has the best growth and is priced accordingly, with a forward P/E of 21.8.|In conclusion, while Target's woes have made the company a cheaper investment, the company looks set to remain a step behind competitors like Costco and Wal-Mart.

Year to date, shares of Wal-Mart are up 12.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is up 21.5%. But as you can see below, Wal-Mart's shares closely followed the ups and downs of both the Dow and the S&P 500, and were nearly beating the two heading into the start of the third quarter of the year.|Wal-Mart's problems in 2013The year started out bad for Wal-Mart, with the company's bribery scandals making breaking news in January. The problems, which started in Mexico in 2012, quickly surfaced around the world in India, Brazil, and China, and while the bulk of this news broke in 2012, more details and the aftermath of the scandal emerged in 2013.|Another problem the company dealt with this year was a series of problems with manufacturers' working conditions. A garment factory fire in Bangladesh during 2012 started the conversation, and the issue kept arising in 2013. In April a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and in October another factory caught fire, and all along the way customers were reminded that these locations produced products for the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart.|In addition to all that, the company faced problems this year with inventory. Hordes of customers and analysts noted that shelves were empty in stores around the country, and many criticized the company for bad customer service. Wal-Mart executives even addressed this issue in a quarterly conference call, stating that they would be hiring more employees and increasing part-time workers' hours to help address store conditions and improve stocking.|But in the face of all these serious public-relations issues, shares still rose more than 14% this year, while the company is expected to increase sales by 1.9% -- which is more impressive than it sounds for a company of Wal-Mart's size. When that is compared to the company's closest competitor, Target (NYSE: TGT) , which is expected to do just $73 billion in sales this year, that expected 1.9% -- or $9 billion -- increase translates to 12% of Target's total revenue. Furthermore, analysts expect Wal-Mart to increase earnings per share from $5.02 in 2012 to $5.17 in 2013, which again would be impressive considering the company's size.|Final thoughtsAs I started this review, I noted that reviewing a company's past can teach an investor some important things. At times in 2013 it would have seemed that Wal-Mart was heading down the tubes, and even now, when reviewing all the bad publicity the company dealt with this year, one could argue that the company is heading in the wrong direction in terms of business ethics.|While those issues may keep some investors at bay or cause them to sell shares, the fact of the matter is that Wal-Mart is alive and not only kicking, but growing its sales and earnings considerably for its owners. The company is big enough to sustain a few blows, which is why the stock still managed to gain almost 13% in 2013. Now, moving forward, if the issues continue and management doesn't clean up its act, the company certainly may suffer -- but current shareholders should at least give the company a little more time before heading for the hills. And lastly, if Wal-Mart managed to perform this well in a difficult year, imagine how much it could grow if the world's largest retailer had an issues-free 2014?|More FoolishnessOh, I forgot to mention one other problem Wal-Mart continued to face in 2013: online retailers, which some believe will be the true death of the retail king.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/23/wait-boeings-union-said-what.aspx|12/23/2013|0|"Boeing"|3|Wait! Boeing's Union Said What?|Boeing's (NYSE: BA) labor negotiations took a turn for the surreal Monday.|Last month, as you may recall, Boeing's biggest labor union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW, District 751, District W-24, voted down a deal to renew and extend its labor contract -- voting 2-to-1 against. Boeing had offered to guarantee union members jobs building its new 777X airliner in Seattle for a decade and longer. But Boeing wanted something in exchange: Union members would need to give up their system of guaranteed pensions for life forever and agree to a series of minimal wage raises -- about 1% per year, every other year (plus minor cost-of-living tweaks).|Weeks later, Boeing returned to the bargaining table with a new offer featuring another $5,000 bonus, on top of $10,000 already offered (albeit six years from now), plus improved dental coverage, and it asked union management to recommend that contract to its members. That's when things got weird.|Big trouble with Big Labor On one hand, local union reps didn't like Boeing's offer at all. Equating a "yes" vote on the offer as "giving away pensions, health care, and future wage growth for 10 long years," they accuse Boeing of offering little more than "economic destruction ... for the next 11 years -- without any opportunity to change those economic proposals or any other provision of the contract."|At the same time, though, Boeing has reached out to the union's top management (which District 751 refers to simply as "the International"), and asked them to call a vote on the contract anyway. Now, International President R. Thomas Buffenbarger -- the same R. Thomas Buffenbarger who in 2008 tried to bleed Boeing's bank account dry with a two-month-long strike -- thinks the locals should give Boeing a listen. On Monday, he set a Jan. 3 date for the vote.|It's hard to see why. Boeing hasn't improved its original offer very much, after all. The union hasn't asked for improvements in the company's 401(k) proposal, either. And if the prospect of seeing 777X jobs going to rival workers in South Carolina, or elsewhere, didn't sway IAM members in November, it's hard to imagine that six weeks have changed their minds much.|Boeing wants your pension. Don't let it ruin your retirementPensions are great, but as we've seen in Boeing's repeated labor negotiations, corporate America has fallen out of love with defined benefits retirement programs.

Click here to get your copy today.|I am in the middle of this drama. There are important improvements. The commitment to build the 737 Max here is extended, the current pay step increase is retained as well as what was mentioned. The first vote was accomplished with very little notice. The probable impact to the individuals and community have come into focus over the p*****g contest between the company, the local, and the international. At this point the union is broken, the only way to heal is to accept the contract and enjoy a decade of stability as Boeing gets recommitted to the Puget Sound. Vote it down and the will be no union without union work here to do. ps. the 401K offer is actually sweet for those already on the payroll.|To say "the 737MAX here is extended" is disingenuous. The amount of money that Boeing has pumped into the Renton site to ramp up to 42 a month starting in January and then seamlessly transition to the MAX is large. There is no realistic way to move that to another location. To do so would be to cut off one's nose to spite their face. These concessions the company is asking for do not reflect the will or desire of local managers in any way, shape or form. This offer of extension should be rebuked and those states salivating over the prospect of having to deal with this kind of blackmail and underhanded business tactic should ask themselves just exactly what kind of prostitute they want to appear to be to their citizens.|Boeing moves to a employer friendly state that wants to reduce unemployment and retain or gain a better middle class. Seattle has diversified their corporate tax base and brought in diverse employers. The IAM will destroy jobs for all of its members as Boeing moves everything away from the fools.|I've got an idea for Boeing. Take your jobs overseas like all the other companies are doing. Even our government did after buying or taking over Chrysler the government sold it to a business located in a foreign country. Effectively moving its profit center to overseas. And I'm sure more and more of their production there as well. Then how smart will these union leaders be? People we better wake up and realize we can only demand so much before the company takes flight out of the US.|The 401k plan looks nice to you? My union gave up on the pensions and now we have a thing called "RISP" So we get a few bucks thrown into our 401ks every paycheck. I rather have the old pension plan that the company use to offer. Also 1% raises for a decade??!? Imagine making the same money you're making now that you did a decade ago. Really people, Boeing makes great profit. There is no excuse outside of greed.|I feel really bad for all the generations of workers this local has now put in the bread lines. welcome to the new Detroit lol come east Boeing. we have hundreds of thousands of workers who without a second guess can cut your cost in half, that is a fact. Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana have really well skilled machinist, engineers, and the empty plants to put your ideas to work in! Indiana alone has 120,000 out of work machinist. I have heard the unemployed engineers in Ohio are around 13,000. come and check us out and give us a chance to show you what we can do to make YOUR dreams and corporate aspirations come true!!|Unions are taking their last gasps........ their death is LONG overdue. Boeing should just say goodbye to the Liberal lala land of Washington & Oregon and relocate all their operations to right-to-work states and overseas.|I can't wait to see the look on Mr.Clark of United Emirates face when Boeing announces that the new 777X designed for them will be built in SC. You will be able to hear a pin drop after that statement. Maybe they can work on a 5 year delay instead of three.SC has produced 14 planes out of 154 & 4 are sitting at Pane field not very profitable.|So if they are not happy with the deal, why not find another job that offers better. Everyone can agree anyone working for Boeing is not struggling to put food on the table, join Spain, Portugal, Ireland it may be sooner than you think.........|Inflation is 2-3% annually compounding. Boeing right now is having no problem making money. Paying their employees 1% increase every other year works out to them making 30% less 10 years from now. That is a raw deal.|I was once a Boeing employee in Lake Charles, La. The Union there never did much for the working people. When we rejected their offer they left town along with their low wages and all the nice big hangers the State built for them to bring their jobs to La. I was making $8.50 hr. as a Landing Gear Mechanic on the KC-135 PDM contract in 1991 . Boeing representatives called a meeting for all employees in one of the hangers and announced they were leaving Lake Charles and all the employees started clapping their hands and cheering as there was now hope a better paying Aircraft company would now come to Lake Charles. A couple years later Grumman came to town and later became Northrop Grumman. They paid well but had a big lay-off in 2005. They are still paying well but ended the pension plan for new hires from what I heard. They also use to furnish health Insurance at no cost for employees with 10 years of service or more but also stop that in the 90's. I am now working as a Correctional Officer for $10.50 hr. with no pension and rather be working for $25 hr. with no pension as maybe the case for Boeing employees. Seems to be a trend with big aircraft companies no days to take pensions away which I don't agree with but its happening. I am 60 years old and living off my small pension from Grumman and my low paying job to make ends meet. With that said I think Boeing employees are better off with a good paying job with no pension offers than no jobs at all.|As a non union Boeing retiree, from MDAC era, who has gone through the retirement system change as proposed by Boeing ( without choice), the change has been dramatic financially. After 19 years in the defined benefit plan, then 10 years in the defined contribution plan, it is estimated that my retirement income is approximately less by $500 to $700 per month because of the change.|I would guess Boeing has a real problem here, because there's a major shortage of machinists in the US right now. Despite some of the comments on here I don't think it would be easy for Boeing to just up and move to SC or my state of MO which made a recent offer to them. I would also guess most machinists would not want to work in a right-to-work state?|The comments about Hostess and the unions are absolutely ridiculous; workers and the unions gave Hostess numerous concessions (wage cuts, etc...) throughout years of contracts while the corporate management was bleeding that company dry, to include illegally looting the pension money put aside for the workers. If you give up your pension for a 401K plan you're losing money, and anyone who thinks a 1% raise is generous from a global wealthy corporation like Boeing is a fool, and not a Motley one at that.|Several key issues are being ignored. The 1% pay raise is in addition to a previously negotiated COLA, something which the IAM enjoys and no one else at Boeing gets. Also, the IAM already has a 401K and a defined defined plan. The new 401K is intended to be a substitute for future deposits to a defined benefit plan. Everyone voting on this contract gets to keep the defined benefit they already have. I believe the company wants to avoid strikes every three years. Typically Boeing strikes recently have coincidentally taken place at the beginning of hunting season and are settled just before the holiday breaks. Coincidence? The 2008 strike caused several long term domestic customers to start talking to Airbus.

Investors were happy to see that Americans' personal spending rose 0.5% in November from October -- the fastest pace since June. Consumer spending is a key driver of the U.S. economy; it represents two-thirds of demand, giving investors confidence in our economy's strengthening momentum. Consumer spending on durable goods, which are big-ticket items that last longer than three years, was even stronger -- climbing 1.9% in November. That bodes well for Boeing (NYSE: BA) , one of the Dow's highest-weighted components.|Boeing's had an excellent year, up 82% in 2013 alone, and the aviation giant continues to make headlines. Boeing's next-generation 777X airplane dominated sales last month at the Dubai Airshow last month, and on Friday the company announced that Cathay Pacific agreed to purchase 21 777-9X airplanes. The order is valued at more than $7 billion and makes the airline the first Asia customer to purchase the airplane. The 777X offers cash-strapped airlines improved payload range while reducing operating costs and will continue to be a big driver of Boeing's growth.|In other Boeing news, unionized machinists will vote on the company's latest proposed contract on Jan. 3. The 777 is manufactured its Everett, Wash., plant, and Boeing will guarantee the facility receives production of the 777X if the workers accept a new proposal that will replace their pension plan with a 401(k)-style savings account. Union members voted 2-1 against an earlier offer in November, but Boeing has made large concessions, including a larger signing bonus, in a new proposal said to "contain significant improvements."|An agreement between Boeing and the union would be a big win for investors, as a large uncertainty would be removed. Failure to reach a deal leaves the possibility of Boeing taking 777X production elsewhere, where it risks a less experienced workforce and thus likely production problems and delays that could weigh down the company's stock.|Dividend stocks like Ford and Boeing can make you richIt's as simple as that.

Even as Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus, a subsidiary of European Aeronautic Defense and Space (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , have been improving the 737 and A320 with features that improve fuel economy and comfort, both aircraft are still based around decades old designs. With a total development cost estimated at nearly $4 billion, Bombardier has already invested a lot of time and money in the C Series and will want to make the most of the program.|Stretched aircraftAerospace manufacturers frequently make multiple capacity iterations of the same aircraft as it not only saves on development costs, but airlines can also benefit from the interchangeability of certain parts. Boeing and Airbus have used this method to develop new versions of the 737, A320, and many other aircraft far faster and cheaper than if they were to design all-new models.|New versions of aircraft with increased passenger capacity are a common iteration seen across many Boeing and Airbus models. Even at launch, Bombardier is showing a larger capacity version of the CS100 called the CS300, but this could just be the start of the C Series' growth.|ComparisonsThe first Boeing 737 aircraft were built in the late 1960s and are now out of production. Replacing them was the Next Generation series (737-600, 737-700, 737-800, 737-900) introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More recently, Boeing has unveiled the 737MAX series (737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9) with its latest set of updates.|Airbus has built its narrow-body line around the A320, creating a larger group of planes known as the A320 family. The A318 and A319 are both smaller than the A320, and the A321 is a larger stretched version. Like Boeing, Airbus is launching updated versions of the family, as it shows off the new A320neo as the two largest commercial jetmakers fight for the narrowbody segment.|They would be silly to do this, and try to compete with the excellent A320neo and B737MAX, not to mention all those thousands of (cheaper) used current versions for sale/lease. They'll have to discount to win sales, and the mature programs have amortized their development costs already. Airbus/Boeing's production efficiency is also great after decades of improving this. The CSeries is a niche aircraft in between the ERJs/CRJs and the globally established narrowbodies, so the situation is not as simple as it made to seem here.

While industry leader Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) hugely disappointed with its lackluster performance, two little peers, Manitowoc (NYSE: MTW) and Terex (NYSE: TEX) , flew to beat Caterpillar by a gaping margin. The year-to-date returns chart for the three stocks may leave you dumbfounded.|Caterpillar is trying hard to end the year on a positive note even as Manitowoc and Terex have zoomed past the 40% return mark. While Caterpillar was hit by a weak mining sector, Terex made the most of an uptick in construction activity in the U.S. But Manitowoc was the real star, having outperformed despite battling a slowdown in its food service equipment business. What clicked for Manitowoc this year, and are the growth catalysts for 2014 good enough for the rally to be sustained?|Delving a little deeper, even as sales from Manitowoc's crane segment jumped nearly 8% for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, sales from its food service segment grew only 2% during the period. Increased demand for cranes, backed by higher construction activity in the U.S., drove Manitowoc's revenue higher. Unlike Caterpillar and Terex, both of which derive nearly three-quarters of their revenue from international markets, Manitowoc gets less than half its sales from outside North America. That clearly worked in Manitowoc's favor this year even as peers bore the brunt of dwindling demand from the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions.|That said, Manitowoc is certainly in a better situation than Caterpillar at the moment. So even if Manitowoc stock were to slow down a bit next year, it will likely outpace Caterpillar. And that should be a good reason to keep Manitowoc on your radar for 2014.

Since the index's lowest ebb, its overseers have replaced six components, and the Dow has surged from below 7,000 points to more than 16,000 points for the first time in its history. Different components will push the Dow more forcefully from one year to the next, but those with share prices that merit heavier weighting in the index's value calculations will always produce outsize movements. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) has been one of the best-performing of the heavier-weighted Dow stocks (those in the top 15 by weighting) since the market bottomed out:|This mediocrity could point to a big swing higher as shareholders catch on to Caterpillar's hidden potential, but it could also be a big red flag warning investors of future weaknesses. Which is more likely? One way to find out is to drill down to the fundamentals.|The year ahead: by the numbers The cause of Caterpillar's huge initial surge and recent leveling-off can be seen in the company's earnings over the past few years, which demonstrate quite clearly the impact of a once-in-a-generation global recession on the fortunes of a heavy-industry manufacturer. Caterpillar's fortunes have historically risen and fallen with the worldwide mining, forestry, and construction industries, and the post-recession period was kind to those sectors ... for a while:|Sources: Morningstar and company press releases. * 2013 EPS result and growth rate are based on Caterpillar's latest (from Q3) estimates.|Caterpillar's weak full-year guidance, last updated along with the release of its third-quarter report, sent shares tumbling in October, but analysts had already been anticipating weakness on the bottom line -- a current average of 19 analysts pegs Caterpillar's 2013 earnings at the same level as the company's own projections. This leaves room for an upside surprise, but given Caterpillar's recent history, this might not be likely. The company has missed earnings estimates in each of its past four quarters, and all but one of these disappointments came in at least 13% weaker than expected.|The question is: can Caterpillar come back from this bust? Analysts expect a rather tepid 6% earnings-per-share growth rate for the coming year, which is weaker than what they project for competitor Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) (a 12% growth rate), and is significantly weaker than expectations for the more specialized Terex (NYSE: TEX) (a 36% growth rate) and Manitowoc (NYSE: MTW) (a 19% growth rate). However, analysts are at least more optimistic for Caterpillar than they are for the prospects of chief American competitor Deere (NYSE: DE) , the only major heavy-machinery maker in this group to sport a negative earnings projection -- analysts expect the farm-focused Deere to generate 8% lower profits in 2014 than it did this year.|Despite these mediocre expectations, Caterpillar boasts a valuation that's higher than all those competitors but Manitowoc and the much-elevated Terex. This is likely among the benefits of being the industry leader: investors are just willing to give you more slack if you're slackening. Deere, by contrast, has a single-digit P/E ratio at the moment:|But this chart masks a rather worrying aspect of Caterpillar's past-year performance. It's lost so little of its market cap because its P/E has nearly doubled in the past year, a surge that only just falls short of Terex's valuation growth. None of the other three companies come close in terms of sheer P/E expansion this year:|This is both a positive and a negative for Caterpillar, but 2014 will likely show which is stronger. On the one hand, it does confirm the general strength of Caterpillar's business and brand with the investing public, which has largely ignored fundamental weaknesses to support the company's share price. On the other hand, Caterpillar's P/E ratio has not risen for an entire year since 2009, when the company was decimated by the financial crisis and saw its gains ride largely on the hopes of a future return to normalcy.|A return to normalcy in 2014 might look like growth back toward Caterpillar's record 2012 results, but Caterpillar itself expects to better 2013's results by no more than roughly 5% on the top or bottom lines. Since the company's own guidance has already looked too optimistic several times this year, investors may have little reason to expect 2014 to look much like 2010, when Caterpillar's valuation began falling back to a more modest level even as profit soared.

Stocks hit record highs today as the most valuable U.S. company, Apple, gained 3.8% on the announcement that it has finally inked a deal with China Mobile. TheS&P 500 and the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) both rose 0.5%. With the major indexes at all-time highs (the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is, too), many observers are warning that stocks are beginning to look expensive, but that's not the case for all Dow components. Three of the four cheapest, ranked by ascending order of forward price-to-earnings multiples are IBM (NYSE: IBM) , Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) .|With a 13.5% year-to-date rise, shares of Chevron are not the worst performers in the Dow, but they did lag the broad market by a pretty good margin. Still, that's the case of every oil and gas "supermajor" this year, as investors raised concerns regarding Big Oil's ability to boost production and reserves -- and the level of investment required to achieve this.|At 10.3 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-estimate, Chevron shares are cheaper, on that measure, than those of the other Dow supermajor, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , at 12.6 times. I would remind investors that Buffett added 40.1 million shares of the latter to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio this year -- the largest new position since he bought IBM. As I see it, both stocks look attractive today, if you're ready to invest over an equity-appropriate minimum holding period of three to five years.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June 2014 expiration for CVX. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $110 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.77. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.6% return against the $110 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to CVX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Chevron Corporation sees its shares fall 10.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $108.23 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.77 from $110), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.|Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 3.2% annualized dividend paid by Chevron Corporation, based on the current share price of $123.19. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 10.69% to reach the $110 strike price.|Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Chevron Corporation, looking at the dividend history chart for CVX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.2% annualized dividend yield.

Why isn't the market buying in?|Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) recent financial analyst conference wasn't taken well by the market, but many commentators missed the fact that Cisco's guidance implied an upgrading of expectations for 2015-2017. It's time to look at what its management actually said about future earnings growth, and decide whether you believe Cisco can hit its targets.|Cisco upgrades guidance for 2015-2017Cisco's management previously outlined its expectations for 5%-7% revenue growth on a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, for the next three to five years. Fast-forward to the recent analyst conference, and management seemed to downgrade expectations by lowering projections for three-to-five-year growth to 3%-6%.|It sounds bad, but actually it's a hike in expectations post-2014. Playing with these assumptions and the updated analyst forecast for a disappointing 2014 gives the following table. The mid-point of Cisco's guidance is taken as the base scenario.|"Old guidance" refers to what Cisco would have achieved had it hit the 6% CAGR target from 2011. "Old adjusted" is what Cisco would have achieved if management had said something like, "2014 is a bad year, but after that we are sticking to our 5%-7% long-term growth target."|Foolish investors will note that the "new guidance" implies higher revenue in 2015-2017 than if Cisco had left its post-2014 targets at 5%-7% revenue growth.|Do you believe in Cisco's numbers?No one is obliged to believe that Cisco will hit this guidance, but if it does, then the stock certainly looks cheap. Cisco has approximately $5.45 billion in net cash, and stripping it out of the market cap means the stock trades on just 7.7 times forward earnings estimates of $1.99.|Cisco's guidance relies on a two-track process of slow growth in its core business (switching and routing), and faster growth in non-core areas like cloud, mobility and wireless, and security. Services growth is contingent upon hardware sales, so it can't be considered in isolation.|Cisco's management hasn't covered itself in glory with its acquisition policy in recent years. For example, Cisco bought Pure Digital Technologies in 2009 for $590 million, only to close its Flip video camera business two years later as smartphones started integrating video cameras. Moreover, Tandberg (video conferencing) was bought in 2010 for $3.3 billion. Below is the segment's revenue since Tandberg was integrated. Although the former Tandberg operations are not broken out, the numbers don't suggest it's been a success. In addition, its videoconferencing rival, Polycom, has struggled, too. In other words, it wasn't a great industry for investors.|Another example is the $6.6 billion acquisition of set-top box manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta in 2006. Cisco is now facing problems with its set top boxes. Service provider revenue fell 13% in the first quarter, with 6% due to the 20% decline in set top box sales. Essentially, Cisco is transitioning its traditional set-top boxes toward cloud-enabled ones. The result was a delay in the purchasing of new products by customers while Cisco decided to keep margins up by rejecting low profit deals on the older technology. This sort of transitional problem is typical in technology and usually tends to be sorted out in a quarter or two. Nevertheless, some analysts are calling for Cisco to exit the business altogether. Again, it doesn't suggest the acquisition was a particularly strong move by Cisco.|Where next for Cisco?Cisco is definitely facing some structural growth issues, and management has struggled to generate shareholder value for some time now. On the other hand, the stock is so hated by Wall Street that its valuation has become compelling.|Cisco just implied better growth from 2015-2017, and the market seems to have (initially, at least) chosen not to believe it. The market has cause to be skeptical, but provided Cisco hits its revenue projections, the stock is a good value on a risk/reward basis.|Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) recent financial analyst conference wasn't taken well by the market, but many commentators missed the fact that Cisco's guidance implied an upgrading of expectations for 2015-2017.

Fast-forward to the recent analyst conference, and management seemed to downgrade expectations by lowering projections for three-to-five-year growth to 3%-6%.|It sounds bad, but actually it's a hike in expectations post-2014. Playing with these assumptions and the updated analyst forecast for a disappointing 2014 gives the following table. The mid-point of Cisco's guidance is taken as the base scenario.|"Old guidance" refers to what Cisco would have achieved had it hit the 6% CAGR target from 2011. "Old adjusted" is what Cisco would have achieved if management had said something like, "2014 is a bad year, but after that we are sticking to our 5%-7% long-term growth target."|Foolish investors will note that the "new guidance" implies higher revenue in 2015-2017 than if Cisco had left its post-2014 targets at 5%-7% revenue growth.|Do you believe in Cisco's numbers?No one is obliged to believe that Cisco will hit this guidance, but if it does, then the stock certainly looks cheap. Cisco has approximately $5.45 billion in net cash, and stripping it out of the market cap means the stock trades on just 7.7 times forward earnings estimates of $1.99.|Cisco's guidance relies on a two-track process of slow growth in its core business (switching and routing), and faster growth in non-core areas like cloud, mobility and wireless, and security. Services growth is contingent upon hardware sales, so it can't be considered in isolation.|Cisco's management hasn't covered itself in glory with its acquisition policy in recent years. For example, Cisco bought Pure Digital Technologies in 2009 for $590 million, only to close its Flip video camera business two years later as smartphones started integrating video cameras. Moreover, Tandberg (video conferencing) was bought in 2010 for $3.3 billion. Below is the segment's revenue since Tandberg was integrated. Although the former Tandberg operations are not broken out, the numbers don't suggest it's been a success. In addition, its videoconferencing rival, Polycom, has struggled, too. In other words, it wasn't a great industry for investors.|Another example is the $6.6 billion acquisition of set-top box manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta in 2006. Cisco is now facing problems with its set top boxes. Service provider revenue fell 13% in the first quarter, with 6% due to the 20% decline in set top box sales. Essentially, Cisco is transitioning its traditional set-top boxes toward cloud-enabled ones. The result was a delay in the purchasing of new products by customers while Cisco decided to keep margins up by rejecting low profit deals on the older technology. This sort of transitional problem is typical in technology and usually tends to be sorted out in a quarter or two. Nevertheless, some analysts are calling for Cisco to exit the business altogether. Again, it doesn't suggest the acquisition was a particularly strong move by Cisco.|Where next for Cisco?Cisco is definitely facing some structural growth issues, and management has struggled to generate shareholder value for some time now. On the other hand, the stock is so hated by Wall Street that its valuation has become compelling.|Cisco just implied better growth from 2015-2017, and the market seems to have (initially, at least) chosen not to believe it. The market has cause to be skeptical, but provided Cisco hits its revenue projections, the stock is a good value on a risk/reward basis.

Stocks hit record highs today as the most valuable U.S. company, Apple, gained 3.8% on the announcement that it has finally inked a deal with China Mobile. TheS&P 500 and the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) both rose 0.5%. With the major indexes at all-time highs (the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is, too), many observers are warning that stocks are beginning to look expensive, but that's not the case for all Dow components. Three of the four cheapest, ranked by ascending order of forward price-to-earnings multiples are IBM (NYSE: IBM) , Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) .|Investors weren't impressed with Cisco Systems' last two quarterly earnings reports, and the stock, which was outperforming the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis through nearly the entire third quarter, is now close to 20 percentage points behind the index. During the last earnings report, in particular, analysts and investors were aghast by the low guidance the company provided for the current quarter (try a year-on-year revenue decline of between 8% and 10% on for size!). As an explanation, CEO John Chambers pointed the finger at depressed demand for Cisco's products across emerging markets.|Nevertheless, at just 10.8 times the next 12 months' earnings per share, the stock's valuation appears to offer some protection against the risk of a near-term slowdown in demand. Intelligent investors will to ask themselves: Five years from now, will global demand for Cisco's products be higher than it is today or lower? If the answer is yes, how we get there is a secondary issue -- some volatility in demand is to be expected.

There are a few big factors that should prove to be very positive catalysts for the profits of both companies over the next several years. These include the housing market, which has more upside potential than people seem to think, and the next generation of a lot of home products, which should trigger a replacement cycle.|Homebuying in the U.S. is at historically low levels, even after the recent gains, which is remarkable considering how affordable it is to buy a house right now with mortgage rates of less than 5% (higher than a year ago but still very low in a historical context). It's not so much that more people are choosing to be renters but that more adults ages 18 to 31 are still living with their parents or in roommate situations than any other time in recent history.|New productsThere are several types of products that are just now becoming accepted on a wide scale that could create lots of additional revenue for home-improvement retailers. Most of what I'm referring to here has to do with "smart-home" technologies. Home Depot's CEO recently mentioned Wi-Fi-enabled locks as a game-changing product, but there are many other such products that could be the next "must-haves" for homeowners.|How many more people do you know that have "high-efficiency" lightbulbs in their home as compared to just a few years ago? The same thing could happen with some of these new, more expensive items. Home Depot now carries a full line of technologically advanced "smart-home" products that help manage energy usage and provide home-automation solutions designed to bring houses into the modern age.|The numbersAt 21.3 times the current fiscal year's expected earnings, Home Depot may seem a bit expensive at first glance. However, take into account that earnings are projected to grow to $4.43 and $5.11 during the next two fiscal years, which translates to an average annual earnings growth rate of 16.7% -- which more than justifies the current valuation multiple.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the October 2014 expiration for INTC. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $20 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 48 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.4% return against the $20 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to INTC's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Intel Corp sees its shares decline 21.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $19.52 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 48 cents from $20), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.|Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the October 2014 expiration, for shareholders of Intel Corp (INTC) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.5% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $30 strike and collecting the premium based on the 47 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 2.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost), for a total of 5.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $30 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but INTC shares would have to climb 18.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 20% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 3.78% to reach the $175 strike price.

The recall covers nearly 750,000 total vials of the vaccine, and although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that potentially affected patients need not worry about complications, it's still an unwanted headache for Merck.|Nonetheless, Gardasil's been an unmitigated success for the company. With HPV a notable problem in America today, Gardasil -- one of only two vaccines approved by regulators to prevent the disease -- has become a hit. The drug racked up more than $1.4 billion through the first nine months of the year, equal to year-over-year revenue growth of more than 20%.

Unmatched brand power, tremendous international footprint, diversified lines of business, great management -- even the most "contrarian" analysts had a hard time speaking anything but praise for one of the world's greatest brands. Last week, the company delivered its latest earnings, showing substantial growth across every single one of its segments, but perhaps not dramatic enough to tweet about. Nike may not forever grow at a lightning pace (and it certainly won't happen with unflinching consistency), but this is one of just a few companies that investors can buy today and check in 20 years later without missing a (material) beat.|Futures orders grew 13% year over year on a worldwide scale, driven by growth in, well, everything. Nike's core brand is showing incredible resilience in the otherwise tepid retail environment, and its Converse segment just posted double-digit sales gains.|DominantNike practically prints cash. The company has the ability to make acquisitions every day and pay top dollar, but it rarely does. Its bolt-on purchases have been wise and addressed markets that the company hasn't already inundated (see: Converse).|The strongest argument against Nike today is a discussion on pricing and valuation. By historical measures, Nike is expensive -- that's because the market has fawned over it, without restraint, since July 2012. No matter how great a company or how impressive its sales figures, market valuation has to approach reality one day. Perhaps now that analysts are worried about the next few quarters, we will see the price come down and valuation correct. But even still, Nike isn't any more expensive than, say, fashion retailer Michael Kors. Kors will grow faster for the next few years, but it's a much harder stock to play for the long term. Hot fashion stocks are fantastic for those who buy them before they earn the "hot" designation. If and when consumers tire of the MK on their purses, investors will need a good reason to justify the multiple.|Nike, on the other hand, is in it for the long run.

Teva will pay royalties to Pfizer under the deal, but don't discount the impact of a generic Viagra. The drug, despite its age, still remains a blockbuster therapy in Pfizer's drug portfolio; it made more than $1.4 billion through the first nine months of 2013 despite losing about 6% of its sales year over year.|Fortunately, 2017's a ways off for Pfizer, and the company will lose patent protection on the drug the same year that rival Big Pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) will lose patent protection on its erectile dysfunction medication, Cialis. Still, it's a reminder that the patent cliff's danger hasn't ended for Pfizer following the withering hit to the company's revenue from the loss of patent protection on former top seller Lipitor. Lipitor's lost roughly half of its sales year over year through the first nine months of the year. While Viagra won't lose as much in sheer sales dollars as Lipitor, it's critically important that Pfizer's standout pipeline continues to deliver new replacements for older drugs.

But a few stocks were doing far better: Dow Jones component Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) was up better than 1%, while Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) rallied nearly 3%. GSV Capital (NASDAQ: GSVC) was up almost 5%.|Verizon leads the Dow higherVerizon wasn't up as much as Apple, but was still leading its index higher. The Dow Jones component rallied more than 1% early on Monday, but unfortunately, there was little news to explain Verizon's move. On Friday, Verizon said it would issue transparency reports that would show how much consumer information it was giving to the U.S. government. While a positive development for privacy advocates, it doesn't seem likely to have a material impact on the wireless provider.|At any rate, Monday's gain adds to what has otherwise been a pretty mediocre year for Verizon. Shares are up just a bit more than 12% in 2013, about half of the Dow Jones' gain.

While these two companies were stars when the economy was getting worse, they're not seeing the same benefits as others as it improves.|Wal-Mart is already seeing same-store sales decline in the U.S, underperforming Target and Costco in that respect. Worse yet, Amazon.com is now as big as Target from a revenue standpoint, and as the online retailer grows it's taking a disproportionate amount of sales from Wal-Mart. Price-sensitive consumers who used to flock to Wal-Mart are now going online, which hurts the company's prospects long term.|The growth in consumer spending should be a positive for Wal-Mart and McDonald's, but market trends may take away some of their upside. I think that's why these stocks are underperforming today and will continue to do so into the future.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/23/why-ae-will-lose-the-battle-over-duck-dynasty.aspx|12/23/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|6|But unlike previous controversies, it seems A&E is the one coming out on the losing side. Deen lost a book deal, was dropped by Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target, and ultimately lost her Food Network TV show. Woods lost his sponsorship relationships with Accenture, Procter & Gamble's Gillette, and PepsiCo's Gatorade (though Nike did stand by him).|Like the failed boycotts against the chicken sandwich maker and the pasta maker, Robertson has seen his sponsors stand by him. Truck suspension manufacturer Skyjacker was the first to publicly state its support; it was soon followed by Under Armour (NYSE: UA) , which said that although it disagrees with his views it will continue sponsoring the show. Wal-Mart, which said at its annual meeting that the show's graphic T-shirts are its best-selling items, reports Duck Dynasty merchandise is selling out now as supporters buy up the gear. The retailer accounts for about half of the show's $400 million or so in annual merchandise sales, carrying hundreds of DD items across some 2,800 stores.|Whereas Wal-Mart originally pounced on the Deen contretemps and dumped the chef, the discount giant has remained mum about Robertson, which in this instance might serve it well. So long as companies choose to develop relationships with celebrities and entertainers living in the public eye, scandals will happen. Here, though, the Robertsons are not manufactured celebrities; they are a successful family by dint of building a duck-hunting business from the ground up without apparently compromising their faith or values.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/23/best-buy-is-playing-to-win.aspx|12/23/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|4|Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) has seen stock appreciation of 225.5% in the past year. If you have been long the company over that time frame, then you might be popping some Dom Perignon as you read this. If so, congratulations. If not, then you might be wondering if the stock will see further gains ahead. That's unpredictable, but we can take a look at the company's recent strategy and how it might impact the underlying business given rising competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) .|Best Buy also had to contend with the massive and powerful Wal-Mart Stores on the brick-and-mortar side, which began offering more in the form of electronics at its everyday low prices.|Between Amazon and Wal-Mart, it seemed as though Best Buy had no shot at survival. And I admit that I might have been wrong on this one. I thought Best Buy was heading for futility. While I wouldn't go bullish on Best Buy just yet, my bearish perspective is fading. That's because this is one of those rare cases where management has figured out a way to put itself ahead of industry trends.|Counter-punchMost retailers feeling the onslaught of Amazon and Wal-Mart will back up against the ropes and continue to take the hits, hoping that industry trends will somehow reverse themselves so they can gather up enough strength to fight back. Unfortunately for these retailers, this doesn't happen. Best Buy has decided to take matters into its own hands, and it has punched back. This counter-punch won't really impact Amazon or Wal-Mart, but it will keep them from steamrolling Best Buy.|Due to the ever-increasing presence of Amazon and the ominous presence of Wal-Mart, Best Buy had been facing pricing pressure for years. This led to margin contractions and weaker bottom lines. Best Buy is still struggling on the bottom line, but its game plan gives it potential going forward.|In order to compete with Amazon and Wal-Mart on price, Best Buy now offers a "Low Price Guarantee," which is a price-matching policy. Contrary to popular belief, this isn't a big growth driver. It's more about the perception by consumers that if they go to Best Buy, they will now receive great value. And this seems to be effective. But that's still not the biggest potential growth catalyst for Best Buy.

E-commerce is one of the bigger waves of the future, and retailers who ignore the trend are going to find themselves well behind their peers. Below, we'll take a look at the top four online retailers based on their 2012 sales: Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) . We'll also take a look at a recent survey that asked consumers about their favorite online retailer. If a company makes the top five on this list, then there's a good chance it will show healthy online sales growth for 2013 as well.|Not only does Wal-Mart rank No. 2 on the "Favorite 50 Online Retailers" list, but it's ranked No. 4 for online retail sales in 2012. What more do investors need to become excited about Wal-Mart again? Is it a growth story? No. But it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a safer option in retail.|Walmart.com averaged 61 million unique visitors per month, a number slightly higher than that of the almighty Apple. However, it's not quite as high as that for Amazon.com. Walmart.com's conversion rate of 3.41% is slightly above average, and the average ticket of $140 is higher than most would expect. Most importantly, online sales grew 20.31% in 2012 over 2011. Given the recent survey about consumers' favorite online retailers, it's likely that Wal-Mart will continue to perform well online.|The only company on this list that should give investors reason for caution is Staples. While Staples will likely survive, it isn't likely to thrive. Amazon is best-of-breed for online retailers. That fact alone should make it a company to consider from an investing standpoint. Apple continues to grow online, but investors expect too much from the company, which keeps the stock from taking off. Wal-Mart is underappreciated.

Today we found out that not only have a number of class action lawsuits been brought against the retailer, but the Department of Justice is now also looking into the matter. This comes after the U.S. Secret Service opened an investigation last week into the hack in which criminals stole about 40 million customers' credit card information between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. It's unknown whether the DOJ and Secret Service are both looking for the criminals or whether Target handled the situation appropriately itself. Not everyone thinks Target has done so, and that's why analysts and other market participants think Wal-Mart will benefit greatly from this problem.

What you might not know is what took place following the breach in regards to customer service and the potential cost implications to Target. Most importantly, how will this impact Target's business going forward, and how will it impact Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) ?|Many retailers in today's world attempt to keep costs low by outsourcing software writing and maintenance. The risk here is that it gives criminals easy access to information. Regardless of who is at fault and what practices Target uses to keep costs low, the bottom line is that Target failed in regards to protecting its customers' personal information. This is going to lead to a lack of trust from its customers. This, naturally, will lead to many of those customers now opting for Wal-Mart or Amazon.|Target tends to attract a wide range of consumers, which has made it successful. There's a very good chance that some customers who are struggling financially will now feel safer at Wal-Mart. And higher-end consumers, or those looking for more convenience, will shop online at Amazon.com.|The bottom lineI'm not bearish on Target, but I'm no longer bullish, at least for the near-to-medium term. The good news for investors is that this incident is likely to lead to market share gains for Wal-Mart and Amazon, making them more appealing investments.

This gives Buffett 60 years' of experience with American Express; which shows the benefits of familiarity, whether there's one share at stake, or approximately 28 million with an estimated market value of $800 million -- like for Berkshire Hathaway in 1994.|In the next decade, American Express would streamline its business, and in the process, spin off both its financial services and investment banking branches into, again, Ameriprise Financial and Lehman Brothers Holdings, respectively.|Buffett consistently preaches the importance of finding companies with "enduring" competitive edge. Remember that word, "enduring," because what matters isn't whether American Express can compete this year, but if it'll consistently compete this decade, and according to Berkshire Hathaway's current holding of approximately 150 million shares with a market value near $11 billion, it seems like he does.|The Gillette Company (now Proctor and Gamble) holding is the epitome of a Buffett-style investment. Companies like Wells Fargo and American Express can be great investments, but they aren't exactly the easiest business models to understand.

Boeing lost that contest to Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and its F-35 stealth fighter. As the Koreans explained, Boeing's jet was cheaper, but what they really wanted was the more advanced F-35. And now it seems that Boeing just can't win ...|This week, down in Brazil, Boeing just saw its F/A-18 fighter rejected despite being technologically superior to the winner ... because it cost too much. (Sheesh!)|And Boeing, offering the F/A-18.|Dirty tricks And fight they did, with French Dassault playing especially dirty, trading favors with then-Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to improve its chances of winning the contract. You can read all about the details of the insider dealing here. But basically, France agreed to buy military equipment from Brazilian defense contractor Embraer (NYSE: ERJ) , and even back an Olympic Games bid for Rio de Janeiro, if Brazil would choose Dassault's planes over those of Saab and Boeing.|This tangled web of favor-trading turned France's pricey Rafale, reportedly as much as $6.2 billion, plus $4 billion for maintenance contracts over 30 years, into the front-runner to win the contract. This was despite reports that Saab was offering to sell Brazil the Gripen for just $6 billion, maintenance included. Boeing's position, lacking Dassault's political connections and charging $7.7 billion for its plane (also including maintenance), looked tenuous in the extreme.|Then Boeing suffered an even bigger setback when news of the NSA spying scandal broke in August, and Brazil took umbrage at reports that the U.S. had been spying on its electronic communications. As one local official put it, Brazil was unwilling to even "talk about the fighters with Boeing" anymore, after that kerfuffle.|Whether it was Boeing's too-high price tag, or the NSA spying scandal that finally scotched Boeing's bid, we may never know for sure. Probably it was the price. At least, Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo reported that price was the reason Brazil ultimately changed its mind and rejected France's Rafale.|What is clear, though, is that Boeing is rapidly running out of fighter jet contracts to lose -- and that's not good news for the company's $16 billion Military Aircraft business. With Lockheed Martin locking up the high end of the fifth-generation fighter jet market, second-tier planebuilders like Saab, Embraer, and now Textron (NYSE: TXT) sniping at the low end, Boeing's stuck in the middle, fighting for share in a shrinking market -- and more often than not, losing.|Invest ahead of the newsWith Brazil's decision made, and so well-publicized, investors are well aware that this is bad news for Boeing and Dassault, and good news for Saab.

Even with stock prices soaring, many of the Dow's components have been flush with cash and eager to return it to shareholders in ways that can boost their stock performance and their per-share earnings. Buybacks fit the bill perfectly for that purpose, but some Dow stocks haven't embraced buybacks as much as others. Among them, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , DuPont (NYSE: DD) , United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) , and Nike (NYSE: NKE) have spent the least on share repurchases over the past 12 months, according to the most recently reported figures from S&P Capital IQ. Let's look at why these companies have cut back and whether it indicates pessimism about their respective stocks going forward.|DuPont's $1 billion buyback authorization late last year followed a poor performance in 2012, with sluggish performance in the global economy hurting its core chemicals business. That investment early in the year turned out to be a good one, with the stock having climbed almost 40% over the past year on greater enthusiasm about its future prospects. With DuPont making major strategic moves to refocus on its agricultural seed, pesticide, and herbicide business, the company is likely waiting to see how events like its planned spinoff of its performance chemicals business work out before committing cash to further stock repurchases.|More often than not, shares purchased by DuPont go right out the door again to feed the obese overhead, executive compensation in this top-heavy Delaware conglomerate!

It wasn't unusual for each company to report negative same-store sales, and some articles even suggested that the traditional housing market had changed. Others still suggested that the American dream of owning a home was dead.|Just a few years later, Lowe's and Home Depot are benefiting from housing's recovery. Unfortunately, Lowe's needs to improve one number if it hopes to take the crown from Home Depot.|Strong resultsIf Lowe's were the only company in the home-improvement industry, this quarter's results would be impressive. However, Lowe's not only must compete with Home Depot but also with traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) .|Home Depot seems to be at the top of the housing food chain with its focus on professional customers and knowledgeable sales staff to help the casual home-improvement customer. Lowe's seems to be content to focus on the retail customer while Wal-Mart offers roughly twice the stores of Lowe's or Home Depot and has expanded its home-improvement section as well.|If we look at Lowe's revenue growth in the current quarter, the numbers look impressive. With revenue growth of slightly more than 7%, Lowe's matched Home Depot's revenue growth. Wal-Mart is focused heavily on the grocery business, and this slower-growing industry contributed to the company's revenue growth of just 2.4%.|In the same way, Lowe's same-store-sales growth of slightly more than 6% was very close to Home Depot's 7%-plus growth. In similar fashion to each company's revenue growth, Wal-Mart's domestic same-store sales growth lagged Lowe's and Home Depot's severely. As you can see, Lowe's investors have a lot to be excited about.|Strong tailwinds support this growth storyOne of the inescapable truths of Lowe's and Home Depot is that their fortunes are tied to the homebuilding industry. Whether it's new homes being built and furnished or existing homes being upgraded and updated, each company benefits from a stronger housing market. Wal-Mart also benefits from an improved housing market but to a lesser extent, as its sales are more diversified.|The good news for all three companies is that multiple homebuilders are reporting strong backlog growth. For instance, Toll Brothers and Lennar both reported backlog unit growth of more than 30%. In addition, Toll Brothers, Lennar, PulteGroup, and KB Home all reported strong pricing gains. With this tailwind supporting the recovery of Lowe's and Home Depot, each company should continue to report strong growth.|The one problemWhile Lowe's and Home Depot reported relatively similar revenue and same-store sales growth, their expense management is one key difference. Wal-Mart might report lower revenue growth, but the company is relatively more efficient.|If you look at each company's spending on selling, general, and administrative expenses, you can clearly see where Lowe's can improve. Wal-Mart's huge size and efficient use of resources allowed the company to report SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue of slightly more than 19%. While Home Depot reported its SG&A expenses used 21% of revenue, Lowe's reported SG&A expenses of more than 24%.|The bottom line is, this affects the bottom lineIn the last nine months, Home Depot generated $0.08 of core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capital expenditures) per dollar of revenue. By comparison, Lowe's reported $0.06 of core free cash flow from each dollar of revenue. Wal-Mart's slower revenue growth and focus on the grocery business caused the company to generate just $0.03 of core free cash flow per dollar of revenue.|As you can see, while Lowe's yield of 1.5% looks similar to Home Depot's yield of around 2%, and is less than the 2.5% yield of Wal-Mart, there are differences below the surface. Wal-Mart is expected to grow earnings by around 9% annually in the next few years, compared to earnings growth of around 18% for both Lowe's and Home Depot.|However, if Lowe's continues to carry a higher and higher SG&A expense, the company's free cash flow generation will likely continue to lag Home Depot's. Since both stocks sell for nearly the same forward P/E ratio, it's hard to recommend Lowe's while Home Depot is available to purchase. The company has been improving, but until its SG&A expense percentage drops, Lowe's will continue to finish in second place.|Home Depot is filthy and constantly screws up my orders. The last one, on Black Friday, they said my they couldn't confirm my home address in Paypal. I've had this Paypal account for 8 years, and run my business through it. I've bought from Lowes, Walmart,Kmart, Sears, Thinkgeek etc, without a problem. When I confronted them about this, they told me to contact Paypal. They just wouldn't take the blame. This was not the first time. But it will be the last time.|I've never spent another cent at Lowes and will drive 8 miles out of my way to Home Depot when I need something. When I ask for help the person will take me to where I need and stay there and help me look for whatever I need and won't leave until I find it.|This is hilarious. Down here in San Antonio, the Home Depot stores are manned by the least helpful or knowledgeable people ever at a building supply store. For years IK drove 15 miles to Lowes when there were 2 HD within 3 miles of my home. We finally got a Lowes in our neighborhood and it is the only place I go for these products. As far as I'm concerned Home Depot should go the way of Builder's Square.

While PepsiCo targets younger generations of soda drinkers, Coca-Cola's tends to control the older demographics. Coca-Cola has always stayed ahead in the soft drink battle, and it now has more than 40% market share in the carbonated soft drink market. PepsiCo ranks second with only 28% market share. However, PepsiCo has fought back aggressively, especially in the restaurant chain market. For instance, PepsiCo has recently replaced Coca-Cola as the beverage supplier of fast-growing restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings (NASDAQ: BWLD) .|Indeed, PepsiCo will be serving Buffalo Wild Wings' 975 restaurants in 49 states and Canada. However, Coca-Cola will still remain the leader in the U.S. fountain soda business, with a whopping market share of 70%. Moreover, in order to generate a higher return on invested capital, Coca-Cola plans to return to its original franchise model in North America instead of the current bottlers ownership model. At the current price of $39.30 per share, Coca-Cola is valued at 17.65 times its forward earnings. PepsiCo has a forward earnings multiple that's a bit lower at 17.17. Both are also quite alike in terms of their dividend yields at 2.80% and their payout ratios of around 52%-57%.|My Foolish takePepsiCo and Coca-Cola are safe bets in the soft drink industry because of their global leadership positions.

The deal has sent Vodafone soaring to a valuation of $180 billion, and in the process, reduced the dividend yield to around 4.2%.|Outside the Verizon Wireless investment, Vodafone is a large wireless provider in the major European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, U.K., Italy, and Spain along with select investments in Africa and Asia. The company has roughly 500 million wireless subscribers around the world making it one of the largest mobile carriers. With the Verizon Wireless deal heading toward completion, the market is starting to wonder if Vodafone can justify its current price.|Reviewing the dealThe deal involves Verizon paying Vodafone total consideration of roughly $130 billion. The primary details include the following:|$60.2 billion in Verizon shares|$5.0 billion in the form of Verizon notes|$3.5 billion in the form of Verizon's 23% minority interest in Vodafone Italy|$2.5 billion in the assumption by Verizon of Vodafone net liabilities relating to Verizon Wireless|At the completion of the deal, Vodafone plans to directly send the Verizon shares and $23.9 billion of cash to shareholders. Those totals represent 71% of the net proceeds.|The Times of India is already claiming that Vodafone plans to spend $3 billion over the next two years to expand its presence in the rural parts of India. It isn't clear whether these expansion plans in India and purchase of cable operators in Europe are related to the cash from the Verizon Wireless deal, but it sure doesn't hurt to have a strong balance sheet.|Bottom lineVodafone is cashing out of the U.S. wireless market with smartphone penetration close to maximum levels. The company is turning around and rewarding shareholders with distributions of Verizon shares and cash. On top of that, Vodafone continues to spend on expanding networks and working on deals for assets in weak economies in Europe and Asia.|Verizon is taking on tons of debt to finance the deal. Ultimately, the valuation of the deal to either company is hard to quantify. Vodafone is investing in the weak European markets and cashing out of the hot U.S. market. It doesn't appear wise now, but it could become one of the best scenarios where a corporation sold an investment at the peak and rolled a portion of the proceeds into deals for cheap assets.

However, Lowe's not only must compete with Home Depot but also with traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) .|Home Depot seems to be at the top of the housing food chain with its focus on professional customers and knowledgeable sales staff to help the casual home-improvement customer. Lowe's seems to be content to focus on the retail customer while Wal-Mart offers roughly twice the stores of Lowe's or Home Depot and has expanded its home-improvement section as well.|If we look at Lowe's revenue growth in the current quarter, the numbers look impressive. With revenue growth of slightly more than 7%, Lowe's matched Home Depot's revenue growth. Wal-Mart is focused heavily on the grocery business, and this slower-growing industry contributed to the company's revenue growth of just 2.4%.|In the same way, Lowe's same-store-sales growth of slightly more than 6% was very close to Home Depot's 7%-plus growth. In similar fashion to each company's revenue growth, Wal-Mart's domestic same-store sales growth lagged Lowe's and Home Depot's severely. As you can see, Lowe's investors have a lot to be excited about.|Strong tailwinds support this growth storyOne of the inescapable truths of Lowe's and Home Depot is that their fortunes are tied to the homebuilding industry. Whether it's new homes being built and furnished or existing homes being upgraded and updated, each company benefits from a stronger housing market. Wal-Mart also benefits from an improved housing market but to a lesser extent, as its sales are more diversified.|The one problemWhile Lowe's and Home Depot reported relatively similar revenue and same-store sales growth, their expense management is one key difference. Wal-Mart might report lower revenue growth, but the company is relatively more efficient.|If you look at each company's spending on selling, general, and administrative expenses, you can clearly see where Lowe's can improve. Wal-Mart's huge size and efficient use of resources allowed the company to report SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue of slightly more than 19%. While Home Depot reported its SG&A expenses used 21% of revenue, Lowe's reported SG&A expenses of more than 24%.|The bottom line is, this affects the bottom lineIn the last nine months, Home Depot generated $0.08 of core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capital expenditures) per dollar of revenue. By comparison, Lowe's reported $0.06 of core free cash flow from each dollar of revenue. Wal-Mart's slower revenue growth and focus on the grocery business caused the company to generate just $0.03 of core free cash flow per dollar of revenue.|As you can see, while Lowe's yield of 1.5% looks similar to Home Depot's yield of around 2%, and is less than the 2.5% yield of Wal-Mart, there are differences below the surface. Wal-Mart is expected to grow earnings by around 9% annually in the next few years, compared to earnings growth of around 18% for both Lowe's and Home Depot.

While the largest provider of prepaid debit cards has successfully survived the onslaught of new prepaid competitors, Green Dot hasn't progressed at all in de-linking itself from Wal-Mart.|Surviving the competitive onslaughtThe measure that competitors took a bite out of Green Dot's growth is best identified by the flat active-card growth over last year. The un-banked market segment is supposed to represent a growth opportunity that didn't materialize via active account growth. Instead, American Express and others absorbed all of the industry growth. On a better note, the key metrics signalling the quality of accounts including cash transfers, gross dollars volume, and purchase volume all generated decent growth despite the lack of active-card growth.|Relinking with Wal-MartAbout a year after the annoucement of the Bluebird prepaid card from American Express, Green Dot upped the relationship with Wal-Mart. During the third quarter, Wal-Mart accounted for 63% of revenue, and the two companies agreed to an expanded suite of prepaid debit cards.|The good news is the American Express prepaid cards are only a threat at the margin.

Getting out of wireless contracts is costly -- early termination fees often total several hundred dollars.|Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint couldn't respond even if they wanted to -- T-Mobile doesn't have early termination fees because it doesn't use the two-year contract model. If you're a T-Mobile subscriber and want to cancel your service, assuming you didn't finance your phone, you won't have to pay anything (if you did, you have to pay off the remaining balance).|How will Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon be affected?To be clear, AT&T and Verizon still have a big advantage over T-Mobile -- their networks are simply better. But for subscribers who are unhappy with their service, or for those who are looking to save money, Un-Carrier 4.0 could prove highly attractive.|It's indisputable that T-Mobile's new moves have had an impact on the industry: After T-Mobile rolled out JUMP, Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T announced similar policies. Earlier in December, AT&T went further, rolling out a plan that would save subscribers money if they paid for their handsets themselves. Even if Un-Carrier 4.0 proves to be something else entirely, investors in AT&T and Verizon should still keep an eye on T-Mobile. The company's innovations have been successful at attracting new subscribers already; as T-Mobile continues to play offense, it could capture even more.|One thing this article does not address - this potential action by T-Mobile would prevent Sprint from buying it out. Why? Because the Justice Department would LOATHE to eliminate the fourth place cell phone company that is the constant discounter. T-Mobile's continuing pressure on the other three only strengthens the Justice's case to keep the forth company independent - to give consumers the greatest opportunity to find an alternative to the "Big 2" (AT&T and Verizon).

http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/12/21/are-these-dow-dividends-in-danger.aspx|12/21/2013|0|"AT&T"|1|Dividend investors love the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) , because all 30 of its components pay dividends. But just because a company is a member of the Dow doesn't mean that it is immune from ever having to cut its dividends. By one popular measure of dividend sustainability, you could conclude that AT&T (NYSE: T) , Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , and Merck (NYSE: MRK) might be paying out too much in dividends. But is that popular measure too simplistic? We'll look at that question later, but first, let's turn to the Dow's history of its component stocks paying dividends to their shareholders.|Will the Dow's dividend stocks cut their payouts?The reason AT&T, Verizon, and Merck come to dividend investors' attention is that they all have high payout ratios, in that their dividends are high in comparison to their earnings. In general, dividend investors prefer to see companies paying no more than they earn. Otherwise, part of the payouts they receive don't represent true net income of the company but rather simply reflect returns of capital from other parts of the business, or even reflect the need for the company to borrow from outside sources to make its quarterly payouts.|In the case of these three stocks, dividend payouts currently exceed earnings. For Verizon, S&P Capital IQ reports earnings of $0.77 per share over the past 12 months, compared to dividend payments of $2.08 per share. For AT&T, the corresponding figures are $1.37 per share in earnings and $1.80 per share in dividends, while Merck's numbers are $1.49 in earnings per share and $1.71 in dividends.|But the underlying assumption behind the earnings payout ratio is that earnings accurately reflect the cash that a company has on hand. With AT&T and Verizon, that assumption is patently false because of the huge capital infrastructure that the wireless-network giants have on their balance sheets. For instance, Verizon has claimed $16.6 billion in depreciation and amortization on its income statement over the past 12 months, pushing the company's free cash flow up to $18.4 billion. That's well over $6 per share in available cash for dividends, leaving Verizon with plenty of room to make its dividend payments. A similar situation faces AT&T, again because depreciating its wireless-network investments produces a wide disparity between available free cash flow and official earnings.

Here's what you need to know.|Poseidon takes on the East Seas Back in January, Boeing delivered the last of its low-rate initial production P-8As to the Navy. Consequently, the Navy's recent deployment of the P-8As to Japan is the first deployment for this aircraft. Moreover, while this deployment is part of a scheduled deployment and isn't the result of escalating tension in that region, it gives the P-8A a chance to prove itself. Capt. Mike Parker, commander, Task Force 72, told DoD Buzz: "We will demonstrate the ability of the P-8A to operate effectively alongside P-3C during high-tempo deployed operations. I also look forward to the P-8A integrating seamlessly with our international partners and allies -- our interoperability will only get better with Poseidon."|P-8A. Photo: Boeing.|According to Boeing, the P-8A is a next-generation, "long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft capable of broad-area, maritime, and littoral operations." More importantly, the P-8A has next-gen sensors, which will help improve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and help actively mitigate the growing threat of next-gen submarines.|Accordingly, if the P-8A proves itself capable of handling this growing threat, Boeing could expect additional orders from America's allies. This would be great news for Boeing, as well as Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) , which provides the directional infrared countermeasures system and the electronic support measures system, Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) , which provides the upgraded AN/APY-10 maritime surveillance radar and signals intelligence solutions, and GeneralElectric's (NYSE: GE) Aviation, which supplies flight-management and stores-management systems.|What to watch Right now, the Navy plans on purchasing 117 P-8As to replace the P-C3, and India placed an order for eight P-8Is, a derivative of the P-8A designed specifically for the Indian navy. Both of these orders are worth a significant amount of money, but it's only the beginning of what Boeing could expect if the P-8A does well in the East Seas. Further, while the escalating tension between Japan and China isn't great, it does give Boeing a chance to demonstrate the ability of the P-8A. Considering the P-8A is already worth billions for Boeing, anything that showcases its ability, and results in orders, is great news for the company.|Boeing rewards investors with dividendsDividend stocks, like Boeing, can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notability of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn.

To illustrate this, you only need to look at how Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) have performed over the past few years. Analyzing this timeframe, investors would see that revenue grew less than 5%, in aggregate, for both of these industry giants. This has left their management trying to find ways to grow, but could the greatest opportunity for them be sitting right beneath their noses?|In all fairness, Lumber Liquidators is only a fraction of the size of Lowe's and Home Depot, which have market caps of $49.3 billion and $111.3 billion, respectively. For this very reason alone, it's understandable that the company could grow so much. What's most impressive though is not just Lumber Liquidators' growth; it's also the margins seen during this growth spurt.|Although this doesn't appear all that great, it's quite impressive when you look at Home Depot and Lowe's. Over the past five years, Home Depot's net profit margin has matched the 4.7% of Lumber Liquidators (albeit with consistent improvements annually, while Lumber Liquidators has been unpredictable). Meanwhile, Lowe's has lagged its competitors with a net profit margin of 4% as its selling, general, and administrative expense, as well as its interest expenses, have ballooned over the years.|Based on this data, it appears as though Lumber Liquidators is a no-brainer. The company has found a way to grow significantly in size while maintaining margins that its largest peers have had difficulty matching. Furthermore, Home Depot and Lowe's may be up for the challenge. Over the past two years, Home Depot has spent $235 million on acquiring other businesses, and Lowe's bought bankrupt specialty retailer Orchard Supply Hardware for $205 million this past August. While these expenditures each make up less than 10% of the market cap of Lumber Liquidators, it demonstrates that both businesses are intent on finding ways to grow.|Or maybe it's not after allThere is one downside to a potential Lumber Liquidators acquisition; it would be pricey. Currently, Lowe's trades at 3.9 times book value and 13.1 times cash flow from operating activities. Home Depot is even cheaper at 3.6 times book value, but more expensive when valued by cash flow from operating activities at 15.9 times.|Add to this the fact that Lowe's has a long-term debt/equity ratio of 0.8 and cash of only $1.2 billion, and it might be borderline impossible for Lowe's to buy up the company. Home Depot, on the other hand, might be a different story. As of its most recent quarterly report, Home Depot had a long-term debt/equity ratio of 0.47 and cash on hand of $4.9 billion. This implies that, even at $3 billion, buying up Lumber Liquidators might be doable. The real question that remains, though, is if Home Depot has the sense or courage to make such a move.|Foolish takeawaySo there you have it! Right now, Lumber Liquidators is growing extremely fast and doing so without saying goodbye to profitability. Based on this alone, the company is a very attractive takeover target for a bigger player like Home Depot or Lowe's. The downside to this, though, is that any sort of purchase would demand a large premium to what Lumber Liquidators might be worth.|Daniel Jones has no position in any stocks mentioned.

We'll look at that question later, but first, let's turn to the Dow's history of its component stocks paying dividends to their shareholders.|Will the Dow's dividend stocks cut their payouts?The reason AT&T, Verizon, and Merck come to dividend investors' attention is that they all have high payout ratios, in that their dividends are high in comparison to their earnings. In general, dividend investors prefer to see companies paying no more than they earn. Otherwise, part of the payouts they receive don't represent true net income of the company but rather simply reflect returns of capital from other parts of the business, or even reflect the need for the company to borrow from outside sources to make its quarterly payouts.|In the case of these three stocks, dividend payouts currently exceed earnings. For Verizon, S&P Capital IQ reports earnings of $0.77 per share over the past 12 months, compared to dividend payments of $2.08 per share. For AT&T, the corresponding figures are $1.37 per share in earnings and $1.80 per share in dividends, while Merck's numbers are $1.49 in earnings per share and $1.71 in dividends.|Merck, on the other hand, doesn't have that accounting excuse. Rather, the decline in Merck earnings has come as a result of the major patent cliff that the company has faced, especially as blockbuster Singulair came off-patent. Dividend investors have to hope that Merck's pipeline of drugs will produce replacements for the revenue that the company will lose to generic competition, but so far, that process has been arduous and has had only mixed success. Although few believe that Merck would cut its dividend, the company needs to demonstrate a solid turnaround before it will be out of dividend danger.

The Tea & Coffee Trade Journal, predicts that private label coffee pods could increase market share from 8% to 12% in 2014.

A New York Times article cited a better match between Buffalo Wild Wings and PepsiCo's product portfolio, along with PepsiCo's sports relationships fitting well with the male demographic of the popular restaurant chain as reason for the switch. Should Coca-Cola investors be worried? Maybe -- here's why.|More friction on Coca-Cola's revenue|In order to understand how this deal might impact Coca-Cola, you need a rough estimate of its effect on the top line. According to its SEC filings, Buffalo Wild Wings averages about $55,000 per week in sales. Now you take a typical fast casual restaurant bill of $10 per person with a $1.79 of that total coming from a Coca-Cola product representing 18% of the total. You then factor out 3% for water and alcohol sales and you arrive at Coca-Cola sales representing 15% of Buffalo Wild Wings sales or roughly $8,250 per week, and that Coca-Cola keeps 30% of that based on Buffalo Wild Wings' cost of sales.|With the loss of this contract to Pepsi, all of this translates into a estimated weekly revenue loss of $2.3 million per week or $122 million per year for Coca-Cola. This only represents 0.25% of Coca-Cola's 2012 revenue. The impact probably doesn't rank that high considering some of the loss gets allocated to Coca-Cola's bottling partners. However, when you factor in a 20%-per-year revenue growth rate (author's estimate based on historical trends) for Buffalo Wild Wings over the next 10 years, the hit to Coca-Cola's top line adds up to approximately $3.8 billion during that time frame..|Start of a new trend?Coca-Cola's shareholders will face the apocalypse if larger chains such as McDonald's were to follow in the footsteps of Buffalo Wild Wings. Imagine the impact if Coca-Cola lost access to McDonald's 34,000 restaurants. Coca-Cola already faces headwinds from the healthy-lifestyles movement. Now it needs to grapple with the possibility of losing clientele to PepsiCo. Perhaps Coca-Cola should diversify its business to include snacks as well.|Buffalo Wild Wings understood that Pepsi had a great deal more to offer than Coca-Cola. The restaurant chain realized it could utilize Pepsi's snack offerings, much like Yum! Brands Taco Bell's used its Doritos for the Doritos Locos Tacos. Moreover, Buffalo Wild Wings can introduce a variety of Mountain Dew drinks in its restaurants, the only carbonated beverage with "rising sales" according to TheNew York Times.|It's a win-win-lose scenario, with Coca-Cola investors on the losing end.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/21/can-whole-foods-really-grow-to-1200-stores.aspx|12/21/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|3|On Tuesday December 17, 2013, John Mackey and Walter Robb, the co-CEO's of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) announced their intention to grow their healthy food store concept to 1,200 locations in the United States. With only 347 locations within the U.S. and another 15 abroad as of its Fiscal 2013, this leaves a lot of work to do and a lot of potential to profit as a shareholder. But you know the saying; money talks and... well... you get the point. Does Whole Foods have what it takes to grow to their lofty goal of 1,200 locations domestically and join the ranks of big players like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) or is this goal too lofty?|Every year since at least 2009, the company has seen its net profit margin improve. Not only that, but its improvement has significantly outpaced both Wal-Mart and Costco, while its average margin smashes Costco's and is on track to surpass Wal-Mart's if the trend continues. This increase in net profit margin over time can be attributed to a 275.3% jump in net income as costs have fallen as a percentage of sales.|If Whole Foods were a big player with more market power or if it was accepting higher margins at the cost of growth, it would make sense for the company's performance to be so impressive. However, neither of these cases appears to be true. Aside from having fewer locations than its peers, the company's market cap of $21.3 billion is a fraction the size of Costco's $51.4 billion or Wal-Mart's gargantuan $250 billion.|Furthermore, the company's revenue has grown by 60.8% from $8 billion to $12.9 billion over this timeframe. This is a nice clip higher than the 47.2% from $71.4 billion to $105.2 billion seen by Costco and worlds apart from the 16% increase from $404.4 billion to $469.2 billion experienced by Wal-Mart.|Currently, shares are trading at 39 times earnings, which is far higher than Wal-Mart and Costco. This suggests Wall Street already expects rapid growth but even if the company increases its store count by the 11% it's expected to next year until it reaches the 1,200 locations it's striving for, shareholders wouldn't see management achieve its goal for another 12 years. So, while investing in Whole Foods will likely pay off big if management can stay the course, investors should sit by the sidelines and wait for the price to make sense to them before jumping in.

While the largest provider of prepaid debit cards has successfully survived the onslaught of new prepaid competitors, Green Dot hasn't progressed at all in de-linking itself from Wal-Mart.|The biggest excitement from Green Dot remains the promising mobile banking product called GoBank. Now, after a year of opening the product for beta testing and approaching six months after opening the product for all banking customers, the company has provided limited data points on the progress. Though the stock has surged this last year, investors are back into a situation of being reliant on Wal-Mart again -- the very issue that led to the stock being crushed in 2012 when it collapsed from more than $30 to less than $10.|Relinking with Wal-MartAbout a year after the annoucement of the Bluebird prepaid card from American Express, Green Dot upped the relationship with Wal-Mart. During the third quarter, Wal-Mart accounted for 63% of revenue, and the two companies agreed to an expanded suite of prepaid debit cards.|The portfolio of reloadable, prepaid debit cards now includes a total of nine cards that range from three levels of Wal-Mart MoneyCard branded products including basic, plus, and preferred levels. Each level offers a different type of service and fees for a different set of uses. Also the portfolio now includes six products in the affinity category, including NFL team cards, NASCAR, and AARP to name a few.|Though the company added around 27,000 retail locations recently to reach more than 80,000 total locations, it still appears that Wal-Mart dominates the category. This deal appears to further link Green Dot with Wal-Mart regardless of the other initiatives, and it subjects investors to the downside potential witnessed last year.|Bottom lineGreen Dot continues to expand retail locations and create new product opportunities with GoBank and check-cashing stores, yet the new deal with Wal-Mart appears to tie the company in with the massive retailer even more closely. It's possible Wal-Mart is the ideal location to sell and reload prepaid debit cards, making all of the expansion into other retailers irrelevant. In that scenario, the key will be the GoBank development that targets a more affluent, mobile customer that wouldn't use the prepaid cards.|Regardless, investors buying today are subject to the risk of being tied into one major customer with no near-term resolution to that issue. Long term, these other initiatives should eventually alleviate this risk, but for now, the company is too tied into Wal-Mart.

Such is the case with The ADT Corporation (NYSE: ADT) and the perceived effects that new market entrants are having upon its operations. ADT shares retrenched in 2013 due to both Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE: T) jumping into the home security and automation market with bundled offerings. ADT shares lost some lustre as investors believed increased competition from well-capitalized firms would lead to a less secure market position. Fortunately for ADT, being the most recognized leader in a contested market can buoy subscriber growth and mitigate losses to competitors.|Competition not as it seemsComcast entered the market with its Xfinity Home offering that ranges from at $19.95-$49.95/month while AT&T is now offering similar pricing for its Digital Life service in 21 markets. ADT presented details of this competitive landscape at its investor day earlier in December. The reality is that Comcast and AT&T have yet to make a dent in ADT's business one year after they began offering security and automation services. As the chart below demonstrates, only 20 basis points of ADT's attrition over the past 12 months can be attributed to loss of subscribers to cable/telecom competitors. Taking a different spin on that piece of data, ADT lost approximately $5.9m in revenue to Comcast and AT&T, a minimal amount of the $3.0bn in sales that ADT generated in FY13. At the same time, ADT has also increased its take of new customers subscribing for services industrywide. Over the past 12 months, ADT secured 46% of new subscribers, which is up from 44% since 2010.|Final thoughtsTo this point, Comcast and AT&T have taken negligible share and ADT is securing its market position. Although the competitive environment will indeed increase in coming years as competitors build out offerings and brand awareness, ADT looks to be well positioned as the industry leader to take the largest slice of a growing market. Reality is not always what we perceive it to be. For ADT, and the industry as a whole, a different question sits at the forefront of my mind. The unknown to be determined factor becomes will pricing turn south and relegate home security and automation services to large scale providers with cost-advantages such as ADT? This outcome is ultimately difficult to predict with any clarity and that could continue to drag on ADT shares.

Saab's Gripen jet offered the best combination of price, transfers of technology to Brazilian companies and low maintenance costs compared with the other two finalists, Boeing and France's Dassault Aviation, Defense Minister Celso Amorim told reporters on Wednesday.|Shortly after Rousseff took office in January 2011, she surprised Republican Senator John McCain when he visited Brasilia by bringing up Boeing's bid and saying she thought its F/A-18 was the best of the three jets, according to two people who were in the room.|Boeing particularly appealed to Rousseff, people familiar with her thinking said, because the company has a growing relationship with Embraer SA and the jet deal would advance the Brazilian planemaker's technological know-how.|Obama visited Brazil in 2011, Rousseff went to the White House in 2012, and the jets deal was discussed at length by the leaders during both trips. But it wasn't until Biden's visit in May that Boeing was finally on the verge of winning the deal, Brazilian officials said.|Rousseff remained concerned that the U.S. Congress, especially Republican Party members who are traditionally skeptical of leftist governments in Latin America, could block the technology transfers on national security grounds even after a deal with Boeing was signed.|Boeing executives, U.S. diplomats and even Brazilian officials were exuberant. The expectation, confirmed by Rousseff's aides, was that she would likely announce her choice of Boeing in October, when she was due to make the first formal state visit to Washington by a Brazilian leader in nearly 20 years.|The optimism began to fade just five weeks later, when the first Brazil-related NSA documents were released. Then, on Sept. 1, when a report said Rousseff herself had been a target, it became clear that all bets were off and that the Boeing bid was in severe danger.|The day after that report, a person who had been pushing for Boeing angrily questioned whether the intelligence obtained from Rousseff's communications justified possibly losing the deal. "Was that worth $4 billion?" the person asked rhetorically, speaking on condition of anonymity.|Rousseff announced on Sept. 17 that she was canceling the state visit. Her aides told Reuters that day that Boeing was likely now out of the running.|Ben Rhodes, a White House national security adviser, told Reuters in October that it was unclear whether the United States could resurrect Boeing's chances of winning the jets deal.|Boeing was out, and the Rafale was by far the most expensive of the three jets, aides said. That left the Gripen, which some elements of the Brazilian Air Force had been pushing for all along. Many defense analysts said that, independent of the politics, it was a solid choice.

The closures would follow the shuttering of Boeing's C-17 military transport plane production, in Long Beach, California, set for 2015, also because of sagging sales.|All these prospects present a near-term threat to Boeing's defense business. Fighters and C-17s accounted for 40 percent of Boeing's military aircraft deliveries so far this year. Military aircraft sales totaled $11.5 billion in the first nine months of 2013, down from $11.9 billion a year ago. (Boeing does not break down revenue by product line.)|Spokesman Conrad Chun said Boeing was disappointed about the loss in Brazil but remained confident about the Super Hornet's prospects in Europe and the Middle East.|Without fighters and the transport planes, Boeing's military aircraft business would be largely reliant on Apache and Chinook helicopters and the P-8 antisubmarine plane.|Boeing's lucrative after-sale market would be undermined as well. More than 80 percent of the money earned on a fighter jet comes from sales of spare parts, upgrades and support services over the jet's lifespan of 30 years.|Boeing executives deny they are in a dogfight with Lockheed's F-35, and say the two jets will be compatible for defense needs on board U.S. aircraft carriers for decades.|But even before the Brazil loss, Boeing was boosting its lobbying efforts to get U.S. lawmakers to buy more F/A-018s or EA-18G electronic attack planes, known as "Growlers."|Boeing still has orders for 73 more F/A-18s and 45 more EA-18Gs, which will carry it to the end of 2016. For Saudi Arabia it is building 84 F-15s, enough to keep production running through 2018.|F/A-18 production is slowing from four planes a month to three to preserve the line, said Mike Gibbons, F/A-18 program manager. Boeing needs to build around two planes a month to maintain it, he said. That would require orders for 60 additional planes from the Navy to carry production through 2020, when countries in the Middle East and others such as Canada and Denmark would need to replace their jets.|Boeing had hoped orders from Brazil, Malaysia and other countries could fill the gap. Now Brazil is a lost cause, and Malaysia recently said it was postponing its fighter competition.|The Gulf holds promise, but Boeing's F/A-18 could face rivalry there from the F-35 around 2020, when the Pentagon is considering allowing sales to the region.|The U.S. Navy is a different story. Officials laud the jet's performance and the ease of maintenance. They say Boeing's reliable F/A-18 deliveries have allowed the fleet to maintain enough fighters on carriers to cover delays in the F-35C, which is not slated to be ready for operational use until 2018 or 2019.|That is why Boeing is turning to lawmakers to add funding for extra F/A-18 planes, which they have done in the past.|Behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, congressional aides briefed on the program say Boeing is pushing a proposal to replace 44 of the 280 F-35 C-models the Navy plans to buy with Super Hornets, a move it argues could save the Navy $2.3 billion over several years.|Boeing has stepped up marketing activities over the past year, bringing a trailer-sized simulator to Capitol Hill, showcasing the Hornet at a variety of foreign air shows and helping organize a 35th anniversary party for its first flight at a Maryland naval air base this month.|How much traction the Boeing proposal will ultimately get in Congress remains unclear.|Boeing's support in Congress has also waned in recent years after the deaths of some key backers, including Senator Ted Stevens and Representative John Murtha. Others lost their seats to Tea Party candidates who care more about cutting federal deficits.|The cost of the F-35 is also dropping, according to program manager Lorraine Martin. Last week she said a conventional takeoff A-model would cost around $75 million in 2019, putting it on par with current planes like the F/A-18 and negating one of Boeing's key selling points.|Boeing says the F/A-18 costs about $51 million, including engines and radar, but congressional aides say the price is closer to $70 million when targeting pods and other equipment that is standard on the F-35 are added.|In the end, one of Boeing's biggest problems may be one faced by all companies as they near the end of production of a product, said one industry executive.|WASHINGTON, Dec 20- Brazil's decision to buy Swedish fighter jets instead of F/A-18 Super Hornets from Boeing eliminates its most promising foreign-sales prospect just as the U.S. company faces critical decisions about extending the jet's production line past 2016..

It's a great sign for Boeing investors as the Asian airline market is booming, particularly in Southeast Asia as of late.|Boeing only began trotting out orders for the 777X aircraft at this year's Dubai Airshow, but it picked up roughly $95 billion worth of commitments there alone. The 777X should also help Boeing counter Airbus' growing clout in the wide-body airliner market as well, as the 777X is larger than Airbus's rival A350.

Although it performed much more strongly during the first half of the year than rivals ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , BP (NYSE: BP) , and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) , Chevron allowed its competitors' returns to catch up with it more recently. The raises the question of whether Chevron faces big challenges for 2014 that it could have difficulty meeting, or whether it's positioning itself for another breakout move higher in the new year.|Chevron has generally done a good job in facing its toughest challenge and keeping production levels growing to the greatest extent possible. With energy prices down over the past year, that goal-meeting hasn't translated into overall revenue growth for Chevron. But with the economy in the U.S. and worldwide starting to get back on track for faster growth rates, rising energy demand could support prices even in a time of plentiful supply and give Chevron shareholders the increased profits they want to see. Let's take a closer look at Chevron's prospects for 2014.|Falling gas prices are just one of the challenges Chevron could face in 2014.|Stats on Chevron|What's in store for Chevron's 2014?Analysts remain somewhat optimistic about Chevron's prospects for 2014. The target stock price would represent an almost 8% rise from current levels. Combined with a solid dividend yield above 3%, reaching those levels would give investors a strong double-digit percentage return for 2014.|Chevron's international expansion will inevitably play a key role in its success, but working abroad has its own complications. Earlier this month, Chevron said it would delay a Chinese gas project over a disagreement with partner PetroChina on the best method for developing the project. Around the world, oil producers are turning to Chevron, Exxon, and other experts in unconventional drilling methods, seeking their expertise both to develop existing prospects and to gain the experience to take on future projects without further assistance. That dynamic puts Chevron and its peers in a tough position of having to defend their intellectual property while still working productively with partners. Meanwhile, controversy over hydraulic fracturing has caused tension in many areas, with protests in the eastern European nation of Romania leading to equipment damage and temporary operational halts there.|Chevron also has some company-specific challenges of its own. Looming over its head is a potential $9.5 billion judgment related to environmental damage in Ecuador, the liability for which Chevron assumed in its takeover of Texaco more than a decade ago. The recent decision by a Canadian court that could expose Chevron's oil-sands assets to that judgment is just the latest wrinkle in what could be a complicated legal battle throughout 2014 and beyond. At the same time, cost overruns on its Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia have raised concerns about the economic viability of using LNG production and transport to get natural gas from lucrative plays off the Australian coast to energy-hungry users in China, India, and key Southeast Asian markets.|Finally, in downstream operations, Chevron and Exxon have chosen not to follow ConocoPhillips and others that have spun off their refining and chemical operations in favor of remaining vertically integrated. Chevron actually just brought on Jon Huntsman Jr. as a board member, potentially signaling an even greater move toward the downstream side of its business given Huntsman's experience in the chemical-manufacturing industry. With spreads between domestic and global crude oil prices having widened again recently, Chevron's prospects in refining and chemical manufacturing have a lot of promise, and that's a big reason why the company has partnered with Phillips 66 on a large-scale ethane-cracking facility that represents a substantial part of Chevron's overall capital budget.|Chevron's 2014 performance will come in large part from factors beyond its control, including market prices for oil, natural gas, and refined products like gasoline and diesel fuel. Yet with ambitious plans to keep expanding production capacity while also making it easier to bring those products to markets where demand is high, Chevron hopes to buck any negative trend in energy prices and take full advantage of all the opportunities in the industry in 2014 and beyond.|Click here to add Chevron to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks.

The athletic apparent behemoth released fiscal second-quarter earnings last night and investors were apparently underwhelmed by 8% revenue growth to $6.4 billion and a 3% increase in net income to $537 million, or $0.59 per share.|Investors never like it when net income grows slower than sales, but Nike is investing in advertising for upcoming events like next year's Olympics and World Cup. These are events that will create value for Nike and its shareholders, so while margins may be down this quarter that investment will drive growth over the long run.|It's impressive how a company of Nike's size can continue to grow at nearly a double-digit pace despite muted economic growth and barely any benefit from China. It was actually Europe that supplied most of Nike's growth, which is shocking considering the weak economy we've seen there.|This stock isn't cheap at 22 times forward estimates, but Nike is one of those companies that seems to never go out of fashion and are consistently able to seize on new market. That's why the stock has been a big winner for investors over the long term; this quarter is a testament to that vision.

This trend continued as Nike's second-quarter earnings came in just ahead of analyst estimates, thanks to 8% revenue growth and increased gross margins.|Nike delivers a solid quarter Nike delivered solid results across the board. On a currency-adjusted basis, Nike grew revenue in each of its geographic regions; of particular note was the strong 15% growth in Western Europe, a stronghold of Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) . Nike's 5% revenue growth in China may not seem like much, but it certainly represents a positive turnaround to a concerning trend in recent quarters.|Thanks to a favorable mix in sales toward higher-margin products, Nike was also able to increase gross margins 140 basis points; this drove diluted earnings per share of $0.59, a penny higher than expectations.|So why the lackluster reaction from the market? Investors are concerned with Nike's 14% uptick in selling, general, and administrative costs. While it is typically not a good thing when expense growth outpaces revenue growth, a little more digging is required to get a true understanding of this number. On the earnings call, CEO Mark Parker attributed this increase to investments that will drive future growth; these investments take the form of both "demand creation" projects such as marketing ramp-up leading into the Olympics, World Cup, and other major sporting events and "strategic initiatives" that develop new products in growth areas such as digital products (e.g., the Fuelband).|Spending that will drive growth by attracting customers and creating innovative new products can hardly be considered a negative for anyone taking a long-term view of the company. Fuelband has taken a leading position in the growing integration of digital technology into fitness. Meanwhile, ramped-up marketing expense for major international events like the Olympics and World Cup present Nike with the opportunity to further gain market share in markets where Adidas has a leading position.|Nike's valuation is more attractive than Under Armour'sUnder Armour is growing faster than Nike, so it is logical that shares of Under Armour deserve a premium. However, the extent of the premium is often debated; as illustrated by this side-by-side comparison, shares of Nike remain far more attractive even on a growth-adjusted basis:|As evidenced by the difference in PEG ratios, investors are placing a huge premium on the expectation that Under Armour will generate earnings growth at a rate almost double that of Nike. Investors often equate growth potential with market-beating returns; while this can certainly be the case, shares of Nike have kept pace with Under Armour over the past year, as illustrated below:|The reason Nike's shares aren't moving higherAfter it delivered another solid quarter and remaining more attractively valued than Under Armour, investors may wonder why shares of Nike aren't moving higher. Quite simply, Nike's performance is already priced into the shares; the company is trading at historically high price-to-sales ratio, as shown below:|At the top of its recent valuation range, it will be hard for shares of Nike to move dramatically higher in the near term; 60% annual increases like those registered in the past year are unlikely to repeat, barring transformative changes to the company. Accordingly, the recent rise in the company's share price will continue to result in the market "yawning" at solid results given that further valuation multiple expansion is hard to justify.

Let's catch up on everything you need to know.|Nike's not looking so bright today as its stock drags despite legitimately good data from the company's most recent quarter. The athletic goods giant posted a 40% gain in fiscal second-quarter net income, and earnings managed to beat out analyst projections. However, revenue still missed analyst predictions despite gaining 8% year over year for the quarter.|Despite that slip, Nike investors have a big reason to love the latest results: China. Nike's fallen off in recent quarters in the world's second-largest economy, but the company pulled in a tough rebound in the quarter by boosting China sales by 5%. Nike even managed to keep up its European momentum, growing western European sales by 12%. With global future orders for Nike goods also booming in the second quarter, the earnings are no reason for a stock decline, even despite shares' impressive year-to-date gains.

Health care's been a mixed bag on the Dow's board this year, but America's largest publicly traded insurer, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) , hasn't been slowed down. UnitedHealth's stock has gained more than 35% year to date, outpacing the bumpy start of Obamacare to pull down a solid 2013 for investors. But what's made this stock and company so successful? Let's see how this Dow health care giant's year has set up UnitedHealth for a strong future.|Obamacare's big shift in health insuranceFor the health insurance industry overall, nothing's been more significant about 2013 than Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act's rollout hasn't gone quite as expected, and its myriad changes and headaches have left some insurers and many investors scratching their heads. Medicare cuts, particularly to Medicare Advantage, have been one of the biggest blows revealed since the Affordable Care Act launched, and UnitedHealth hasn't sat idly by.|The company announced in November that it would reduce the size of its physician network, a measure partly responding to those Medicare cuts that will make the costs of treating Medicare-covered Americans tougher in years ahead. It's a tough pill to swallow for both patients and investors, but it's a necessary one: UnitedHealth's costs already have been rising, with medical expenses jumping by more than 12% year over year through the first nine months of 2013.|UnitedHealth's operating costs, while only about 20% as large as medical expenses, have risen at an even-faster 14% over the same time frame. The company can't afford to experience reductions to its Medicare payments while costs are on the rise -- something that won't be helped by Obamacare's tepid enrollment numbers so far -- and November's announcement should at least stem the bleeding.|Despite Obamacare's rocky rollout, UnitedHealth built up some great momentum in 2013 that should help it maintain its place atop the health insurance industry.|Growth in the right placesEven though costs have been picking up, UnitedHealth's managed to drive its own revenue higher. The company's premium revenue climbed by nearly 11% through the first nine months of the year, and adding millions of new subscribers from the military's TRICARE network has helped that mark in a big way.|International revenue also has become a big selling point for UnitedHealth. That's a critical step forward to lessening the company's exposure to Obamacare in future years, something that many of its top rivals can't say the same about. Within the core UnitedHealthcare business, international revenue now makes up more than 5% of sales. That might not seem like much, but considering that UnitedHealthcare International barely got its feet wet in 2012, it's a big jump in 2013 that will pay dividends down the road.|Perhaps most important for the future, UnitedHealth has seen membership growth skyrocket in 2013. True, about a third of that subscriber growth can be attributed to TRICARE, which added nearly 3 million new plans to the company's subscriber rolls. However, UnitedHealth also managed to grow its largest pool of plans -- its commercial fee-based plans -- by 8% through the first nine months of the year.|One slight caveat: UnitedHealth's Medicare Advantage membership growth also has been a big gainer in 2013, picking up 17% growth year over year. While that's great for revenue and lessening risk, it's also a mixed blessing considering the payout cuts to come from the federal government next year. Nonetheless, if UnitedHealth can continue growing its commercial plans strongly in the new year and see its international investments -- such as its purchase of Brazilian insurer Amil last year -- pay off, it will be able to overcome Medicare cuts in the future.|No change in UnitedHealth's market leadershipAll in all, membership growth and rising revenue have 2013 looking strong for UnitedHealth and its members. The year's been one of change and fraught with anxiety for many investors in the industry over the Affordable Care Act's transformation of the marketplace. Yet even with this big change in place, UnitedHealth's come out exactly where it entered the year -- atop the list of America's largest publicly traded health insurers, confidently moving forward and entrenched in its leading position.|Are you ready for Obamacare's future?Nobody's figured out Obamacare completely just yet, but UnitedHealth has the pieces in place to overcome the big changes coming from this law. Can your portfolio say the same? Obamacare seems complex, but it doesn't have to be.

At that time, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) was the dominating force in retail. Some might say it still is today considering that it generates more sales than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) on an annual basis. However, investors care about growth more than anything else, and Amazon is growing at a much more rapid rate than Wal-Mart. Then there's Target (NYSE: TGT) , which has always been seen as a smaller version of Wal-Mart. It hasn't grown nearly as fast as Amazon, either.|Wal-Mart and Target both have plans to improve their top lines, and these plans have good potential. Let's see what they have in store.|Big goes smallWal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world, with 11,000 stores across 26 countries and a market cap of $250 billion. Wal-Mart's stores are known for their sheer size (the majority are 180,000 square feet), where you can spend hours searching for everyday low prices on a broad variety of products. However, the Wal-Mart you know so well might be in the early stages of changing.|Usually when it's reported that a retailer aims to become smaller, this indicates that the company is having trouble with profitability and must divest numerous underperforming locations in order to meet expectations on the bottom line. Wal-Mart's situation is nothing of the sort.|Wal-Mart has no problem with profitability, and it generates a ton of cash -- $23 billion in operating cash flow over the past year to be exact. This allows Wal-Mart to consistently return capital to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. Now add some growth potential to the picture and it could once again become one of the best retail investments on the planet, or at least one of the safest.|Over the next 18 months, Wal-Mart plans on opening 200 Neighborhood Market stores, which would bring the Neighborhood Market store total to 500. These stores are much smaller than the average Wal-Mart, ranging from 38,000-40,000 square feet. However, this smaller version of Wal-Mart isn't the big news. An even smaller version of the store is the bigger news, at least in my opinion.|Wal-Mart only has 20 Wal-Mart Express stores at the moment, but according to Wal-Mart, all of them are performing very well. Importantly, they also allow for fast delivery of online orders, which goes back to the Amazon comparisons above. On top of that, Wal-Mart believes that its Wal-Mart Express stores can steal market share from pretty much any type of brick-and-mortar retailer, as the stores will offer very competitive prices for groceries, pharmaceutical items, gasoline, and more.|Additionally, Wal-Mart plans on expanding its distribution centers, which will lead to lower costs, faster deliveries, and increased competitive capabilities versus Amazon. Wal-Mart already has a presence within five miles of approximately 67% of the U.S. population. With its added distribution centers, Neighborhood Market stores, and Wal-Mart Express stores, it will get even closer.|On-trend with consumer demographicsTarget might not be as big as Wal-Mart, but many consumers see its stores as having a cleaner and more pleasant atmosphere. This in itself is a potential growth catalyst. However, the real growth potential comes with the company's geographical expansion. While the big news is Target's expansion into Canada, the company's CityTarget stores also have enormous potential.|Wal-Mart, Target, or Amazon?Amazon is by far the best growth story here, and that trend should continue as more people continue to shop online. However, Amazon trades at 145 times forward earnings, and it doesn't pay a dividend. Therefore, it's higher risk than Wal-Mart and Target, which trade at just 14 and 13 times forward earnings, respectively. Also, Wal-Mart and Target yield 2.40% and 2.70%, respectively. If you don't mind risk, then Amazon will be your best bet. If you prefer to play it closer to the vest, then Wal-Mart and Target are about on an equal playing field in regard to potential and capital returns to shareholders at the moment.

But when you consider that the average gained almost 300 points yesterday, simply managing to hold onto all those gains is a feat in itself. With Fed policy established for the foreseeable future, end-of-year cross-currents and company-specific news are likely to be the biggest movers for stocks. Still, the plunge in the gold market could have a big impact on Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) , while Nike's (NYSE: NKE) earnings report should get attention in tomorrow's trading.|Unfortunately, today's big drop in gold prices doesn't tell the same story for Caterpillar and, to a lesser extent, General Electric. Gold fell below the $1,200 per ounce mark on Thursday to its lowest level in three years, putting mining companies at further risk of not being able to operate profitably if the bearish trend continues. That's a major problem for Caterpillar, which made a big move into mining equipment production with its purchase of Bucyrus in 2011. With miners scrambling to cut costs, major capital expenditures aren't likely to come any sooner than absolutely necessary, and that will weigh on Caterpillar's results.|Meanwhile, for General Electric, drops of 2% to 3% in gold and silver prices won't have quite the same impact, as GE has only recently gotten more involved in the mining-equipment industry. Nevertheless, with the company looking to boost its manufacturing and industrial businesses, General Electric would have preferred to see favorable conditions in the mining industry. That's looking increasingly unlikely as the bottom continues to fall out of the precious-metals market.

Up to now, these companies haven't done much to compete head-on with SodaStream in the home-soda-making business. For now SodaStream isn't putting much of a dent in Coca-Cola and PepsiCo's revenues.|In the third quarter, Coca-Cola's revenue slipped by 2.5%; PepsiCo's net revenue rose slightly by 1.5%. These companies aren't likely to increase their sales by a high rate due to their large size and market share. Their moderate changes in revenue are mostly driven by seasonal changes, local competition, and economic developments. In North America, SodaStream's net revenue was only $50 million during the third quarter. In comparison, Coca-Cola's revenue was $5.7 billion in North America -- this means SodaStream's revenue was less than 1% of Coca-Cola's revenue in North America.|ProfitabilityDuring the third quarter, SodaStream's profitability reached 12.5% -- a slight decline from last year; in the 2012 third quarter, the profit margin was 14.6%. In comparison, Coca-Cola's profitability reached more than 20% in the third quarter; PepsiCo's, 16.4%. These higher profit margins enable these companies to provide a reasonable dividend; both Coca-Cola's and PepsiCo's annual dividend yield is around 2.8%.|The table compares the enterprise value-to-earnings before interest and taxes ratios of SodaStream, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo to the beverage industry. As you can see, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are, as expected, in line with the industry average, while SodaStream's valuation remains higher by more than 30% of the industry's average. A higher ratio is expected for SodaStream considering its high growth in sales. But this also means the company's current price isn't much of a bargain.|The Foolish bottom lineSodaStream is a great company that continues to find ways to maintain its high growth rate. As long as the company doesn't have to directly compete with other beverage companies, it could maintain its growth. On the other hand, if the company continues to grow at its current pace, this could result in Coca-Cola or PepsiCo or both engaging in direct competition -- releasing their own soda maker.|Fool contributor Lior Cohen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This giant health insurance, benefits, and health technology company has built its way to the top of the heap through strong management, ongoing M&A, and substantial reinvestment in the business, but the arrival of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as "Obamacare") is going to significantly change the way health insurance markets operate for UnitedHealth and large peers like WellPoint (NYSE: WLP) , Aetna (NYSE: AET) , and Cigna (NYSE: CI) . While most of the panic has worn off, investors may yet have a worthwhile long-term opportunity in this health care giant.|Watch and waitLike Cigna and Aetna, UnitedHealth has been relatively cautious and conservative in participating in state exchanges at this point. While Cigna doesn't have a long history of selling individual insurance in very many states, these companies have only decided to participate to the tune of single digits.|The motivation behind this caution is relatively straightforward -- insurance companies are worried that only those most likely to use health care will be signing up right away, with healthier people staying away and choosing to pay fines instead. That makes it tricky to price these policies appropriately; while UnitedHealth has reams and reams of data on health care costs, trends, and consumption patterns, this is a new and different risk pool. So, they're doing what most insurers do when faced with a new business -- they're wading in slowly.|There's really not much for UnitedHealth to lose here by waiting. Rivals like WellPoint are participating more aggressively, mostly to maintain their Blue Cross Blue Shield businesses in 14 states, but I do not believe there will be all that much loyalty in these exchange-based products . If and when UnitedHealth steps in later, I believe customers will evaluate them on the price and features of their plans, not on whether they were there from day one.|A fringe benefit to Medicaid?The ACA enrollment process may also end up benefiting UnitedHealth in a couple of ways that were not part of the original plan. The one-year extension on plans that would otherwise be canceled shouldn't do UnitedHealth any harm, as the plans were profitable for them.|Medicaid may also end up being an unexpected benefit to UnitedHealth in this process. A surprisingly large number of people using the Health Exchange website have discovered that they are eligible for Medicaid coverage. As the second-largest administrator of Medicaid plans, that means more potential covered lives (and more revenue and profits) for UnitedHealth, as well as market share leader WellPoint. Medicaid is not as much of a driver for Cigna and Aetna, though Aetna did increase its Medicaid exposure with the Coventry deal in 2012.|Optum and Amil offer interesting growth possibilitiesOne of the things I really like about UnitedHealth is its growth prospects outside of its historical core insurance operations. Under the Optum banner, services like disease management, specialty benefits, software/services, and pharmacy benefits management give the company some high-growth addressable markets that generally fall outside of regulated markets. True, there is competition here from sizable rivals like Cerner and Express Scripts, but UnitedHealth has been more than holding its own (and, perhaps in a bit of irony, got the general contractor role in the "tech surge" to fix the Healthcare.gov website).|Last and least is Amil, the Brazilian health insurance company that UnitedHealth acquired in 2012. Although Brazil has a universal health program, the program uses a hybrid design that allows people to buy private insurance that offers different levels of access, services, and so on than the government-sponsored system. Banco Bradesco has had more than 50% share in the Brazilian market for some time, but it has never had to compete with the likes of UnitedHealth before, and I like UnitedHealth's odds for gaining share in this market.|The bottom lineWellPoint has also tried to increase its non-premium-based businesses, but acquisitions like 1-800 Contacts haven't been as well-received as UnitedHealth's moves. Even so, I expect other insurance companies to follow UnitedHealth into non-regulated lines of business that can offer good combinations of growth, margins, and cash flow.|As it stands today, UnitedHealth is a so-so stock. I am very much inclined not to underestimate a company that has done so well for so long, particularly given the company's growth potential in Medicare Advantage and non-insurance operations. An excess returns model (a model based around estimated ROE and commonly used to value banks and insurance companies) suggests UnitedHealth is fairly valued if it can limit the erosion in ROE to 15% (against a trailing 5-year average of nearly 18%). If UnitedHealth can maintain its ROE at its recent rate of 17.5%, the fair value jumps to just over $80. A discounted cash flow model likewise suggests undervaluation, as a forward free cash flow growth rate of 5% (against a trailing rate of almost 5%) results in a target in the low $80s.|I do believe there is some risk that the market is underestimating the cost and medical loss impacts of the ACA over the next couple of years. Even if that's true, though, I think that could create some excellent buying opportunities in UnitedHealth. This company is a master of pricing risk and managing expenses, and with several high-quality non-insurance businesses I like the company's growth prospects.

But has the company improved its growth in sales per store? Let's examine how much of Wal-Mart's growth in sales comes from opening new stores and how much stems from organic growth. Finally, let's analyze the company's performance compared to other leading retail giants such as Target (NYSE: TGT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) .|Retail sales continue to slowly riseBefore we start breaking down Wal-Mart's performance, let's see how the U.S retail market has done so far this year. During the past 11 months, U.S retail sales of general-merchandise stores grew by only 0.6%, year over year. Further, during the third-quarter, general-merchandise stores' sales rose by a slight 1.1%. Using this benchmark, let's see how Wal-Mart has done in the past quarter.|During the third-quarter, Wal-Mart's sales increased by 1.6%. Moreover, its operating profit rose by 3.6%. The table below breaks down the company's three main business segments: U.S, international and Sam's club.|Source of data: Wal-Mart website|As you can see above, the company's highest growth in sales was in the U.S -- sales grew by 2.4%. On the other hand, the company's highest growth rate in sales was in Sam's Club -- a 9.2% gain. Nonetheless, the most profitable segment remains Wal-Mart U.S with a profit margin of 7.6%. This means the company's profitability improved on account of Wal-Mart U.S. If this trend persists, this could further improve the company's profitability.|Finally, at first glance, the company's growth in sales in the U.S was higher than that of U.S general-merchandise-stores sales -- another positive sign that Wal-Mart has outperformed the market. But a closer examination reveals that most of the growth is related to opening new stores. The table below summarizes the change in the number of stores in the past quarter.|Source of Data: Wal-Mart website|Source of Data: Wal-Mart website|Let's turn to the Wal-Mart's competitors and see how the company has done with respect to its peers.|Has the competition done any better?To answer this question, let's consider two of Wal-Mart's competitors: Target and Costco. The comparison will take into account the growth in the number of stores and any change in average store sales.|Costco , much like Wal-Mart, had a moderate increase in sales -- a 0.8% gain -- but a relatively high gain in new stores -- a 5% increase. In total, the company's sales per store declined by 4%. Finally, Costco's operating profit per store also declined by a similar rate.|Based on the above, Target has done a bit better than Wal-Mart in terms of growth in sales per store but none of these companies have done better than Wal-Mart in terms of growth in operating profit per store.|Foolish bottom lineWal-Mart hasn't outperformed its peers in terms of growth in sales in the past quarter. Moreover, it hasn't done any better in improving its sales per store. The company's growth was mostly driven by opening new stores, and the international segment has led the way in this area. Down the line, this could curb its progress and reduce Wal-Mart's profit margin. Therefore, the company's strategy (such as expanding outside of the U.S) could, in the coming quarters, impede its growth in sales, which could pressure Wal-Mart's valuation.|That's a good point. I didn't remove this factor. I also think this is another factor that may have adversely affected same store revenues. Since such an impact doesn't serve well Wal-Mart's investment to open new stores, it should be taken into account.

It also named Dennis Muilenburg as Boeing's vice chairman, president, and chief operating officer; he will join the corporate team in Chicago, sharing day-to-day business operations with CEO Jim McNerney.|On top of those two events, Boeing announced it is narrowing its list of sites for the highly anticipated 777X production that has roughly 22 states jumping over each other to win. The aviation juggernaut plans to slash the list to a few top picks by the end of the week. Boeing had previously offered a contract to the machinists union that would guarantee 777X production of its Everett, Wash., plant, but that offer was soundly rejected by a two-thirds vote in November.|This will be an important decision for investors, as Boeing's workforce at Everett is very experienced with production of the 777X's predecessor airplane. If Boeing opts to play hardball and take production elsewhere, it could face a less-experienced workforce that could lead to production problems, budget overruns, and delays -- which is a must-avoid situation after such problems popped up with its 787 Dreamliner production.|Boeing extorted the machinists and lost that vote to freeze workers pay for 8 years. Now they will punish their 50 year loyal workers by taking their wing somewhere else. It would serve Boeing right if the plants in Seattle get the new work from Airbus and don't need Boeing. Boeing can suffer from inexperienced workers and learning curve slow down.

You could almost buy every single piece of property in Manhattan. Or you could fund capital expenditures of the energy industry for just this year. According to a recent report by Barclays, the entire industry will spend $723 billion on development this year alone, a 6.1% jump on this year's record-breaking pace. What is even more surprising about that figure, though, is that the largest companies in the space such as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) plan on spending less over the next few years. If the biggest players in the industry are winding down spending but total spending expects to increase, then which companies are stepping up to fill that gap? Let's take a look at some of the new big spenders and what this may mean for energy investments.|"Go ahead, I'm going to take a breather for this round"Over the past half decade or so, integrated majors have inhaled capital for development faster than Cookie Monster could. To understand why these companies were willing to spend so much money, we need to remember what the climate was four or five years ago. Themes like peak oil were in vogue and fears of oil prices climbing past $150 made even the most expensive projects seem like having a personal ATM. Unfortunately for them, the emergence of shale oil and gas in the U.S., increased offshore activity in the Golden Triangle -- a region bounded by the Gulf of Mexico, West coast of Sub-Saharan Africa, and Brazil -- and decreasing demand in developed nations have brought oil prices back to more sane levels. By the time these events occurred, companies like Chevron and Exxon had already poured big bucks into major projects, and cutting bait on these projects wasn't the best option, either.|So now that many of these projects are finishing the development phase and coming online, companies do not see the impetus to invest in as many major projects for a while. Chevron has announced its 2014 capital budget at $39.8 billion, which is about $2 billion less than this years estimated total. Also, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) , and Total (NYSE: TOT) have all said on recent conference calls and press releases that this year will be the largest in terms of capital spending for the next few years as they start to cash in on those projects.|The Motley Fool recommends Chevron and Total (ADR).

DuPont operates in more than 90 countries and boasts in excess of 150 research and development centers and 70,000 employees. Over the past century, the company has operated in such diverse segments as gunpowder, automobiles, fabrics, plastics, agriculture, construction, electronics, and nutrition, and it continues to produce innovative new chemicals and products today. DuPont even broke into the energy industry with its acquisition of Conoco in 1981, but this tie-up ended in 1998.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak) DuPont began its payouts about 110 years ago. Dow Chemical began paying quarterly dividends in 1977 and has been paying ever since. A 37-year long dividend-paying streak might be impressive in most cases, but it can't hold a candle to DoPont's streak.|Winner: DuPont, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) According to Dividata, DuPont and Dow Chemical's dividend payouts were both hurt by the financial crisis. DuPont held payouts steady from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2012, while Dow actually reduced its payouts in 2008, only to increase them again in 2011. Since Dow's current payout remains below the level its of pre-crisis dividends, we'll award this point to DoPont as well.|Winner: DuPont, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats DuPont may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Dow Chemical has a better shot at long-term outperformance, thanks to its dominant position in the U.S. chemicals market, which has been depressed in recent years and which could enjoy a rebound in prices and demand. International markets also present major opportunities, should many beleaguered nations shift to higher growth. DuPont, on the other hand, has been going through extensive restructuring, which has included acquisitions, spinoffs, and divestitures, to concentrate on high-margin businesses. DuPont is also likely to be hurt by any backlash over GM crops, as it's one of the world's largest seed companies. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others. Keep your eyes open -- you never know where you might find the next great dividend stock!|By revenue, the much shrunken and shrinking DuPont had fallen from #1 in the world amongst chemical enterprises in the last century to a lowly #10 by 2008. Ironically within 18 months, DuPont Management will have dumped its chemicals unit, and can hardly be termed a "chemical manufacturer".|Spin-off (apparently no buyers are willing to take on the legacy of litigation claims, environmental risks, run-down, severely cost-slashed plants and facilities, and massive pension underfunding) will encompass not only TIO2 where DuPont is the world's largest and most advanced producer, but Teflon, acids, and refrigerants as well.|For the full year 2012, DuPont's chemicals unit supplied DuPont 20% of its revenues and 29% of its earnings. Absent the cash flow from chemicals, DuPont may not be able to continue its rich quarterly dividend of 45 cents. ...funfun..

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) acquired Synthes to become the largest in trauma and the second-largest in spine, while Stryker (NYSE: SYK) acquired MAKO Surgical with an eye toward getting ahead of the evolution of the hip and knee markets. Smith & Nephew has diversified into wound care and arthroscopy, while Biomet is reportedly weighing its options, including a possible IPO. That leaves Zimmer Holdings (NYSE: ZMH) as the next major player to move.|Zimmer has already done what many of its rivals have found hard to do -- deliver real growth in a tough major joint recon market. Zimmer's knee sales were up 7% in the latest quarter, while hips were up 2%, and recent introductions like the Persona line have helped extend the company's lead in major joint reconstruction, with more than one-quarter market share (Johnson & Johnson is a few points behind, and Stryker is even further back). With a relatively clean balance sheet and some obvious areas to improve, though, Zimmer could have a trick up its sleeve to invigorate growth.|Hips and knees a good news, bad news situationThe good news for Zimmer is that its cornerstone franchise in major joint reconstruction (hips and knees) has been moving from strength to strength. Long a major player in the space, the company has made some investments in implant systems that allow surgeons to better personalize the procedure for the patient. With the Persona and Continuum lines, patients can get better long-term results including less pain, a better range of motion, and a more natural feel after the implant procedure. That's a powerful marketing angle for Zimmer, one that Stryker has found challenging to combat. Johnson & Johnson has also made strides on the personalization front.|Weaker in more attractive areasWhat hurts Zimmer relative to the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Stryker is that the company is quite strong in the slow-growing major joint recon market, but it is not as strong in areas like spine, trauma, dental, extremities, and non-ortho businesses.|An acquisition of a company like NuVasive or Globus could vault Zimmer back into relevance in spine, but the safer course may be to divest. Likewise in trauma, where the Natural Nail platform is a solid business, but not enough to give the company real scale next to Johnson & Johnson or Stryker.

One stock that fits that bill is Merck, which seems to offer a potent mix of great value and high quality, topped off with impressive future growth prospects. It trades at a forward P/E of just 13.9, well below the S&P 500's P/E of over 16.|This discount is vast: Merck currently trades at a 14.5% discount to the S&P 500 and appears to offer great value at a time when stocks offering such discounts appear to be rather thin on the ground.|Furthermore, it appears as though such a large discount is without merit -- Merck looks financially sound and with encouraging prospects and, as with many of its pharma peers, benefits from substantial barriers to entry in the form of patents.|Many investors (not Fools, of course) overlook patents, but they provide a great deal of revenue visibility and earnings stability. This means that major pharma players such as Merck are less likely to see profits substantially down over a three-year period, and this, in turn, provides investors with increased stability and more consistent returns over the long run.|Merck's pipeline appears to be very encouraging, with 20 programs in phase 2 clinical trials, 13 in phase 3, and nine drugs under FDA review. Merck thus has options for when the current patents on its blockbuster drugs run out, and although the outcomes of drug trials and reviews are inherently uncertain, such a list of programs should mean revenue increases over the medium to long term.|Of course, with the S&P 500 continuing to tick ever higher as the Federal Reserve manages the tapering of its monthly asset purchase program, it could be that Fools are seeking out companies that may fall less than their peers. Merck's beta of 0.6 means that for every 1% fall in the S&P 500, Merck should (in theory) fall by just 0.6%, with the opposite being true if markets were to rise.|That could become increasingly relevant as the Fed makes more substantial inroads into the tapering of its monthly asset-purchase program in 2014. In short, Merck is going to be a stock to watch.

But even as investors celebrated Nike's success by sending shares to record highs earlier this month, the big question is whether the athletic-wear giant can justify its place in the blue-chip index by continuing to dominate the industry despite challenges from Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA) .|Nike has done an excellent job over its long history in making moves to enhance its brand presence both in the core North American market and around the world. Those efforts have boosted the value of Nike's brand into the top 25, according to Interbrand, with a global value of more than $17 billion. Nike has translated that brand into premium sales, getting consumers even in less economically prosperous regions to pay up for its products. Yet Adidas and Under Armour have no intention of letting Nike win without a fight, and they've worked harder recently to cement their own growth prospects in athletic apparel. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Nike over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report that could move the Dow.|Stats on Nike|Can Nike earnings keep jumping higher this quarter?Investors have seen a mixed picture from analysts following Nike earnings recently, as they've cut estimates by $0.03 per share for the quarter ended in November but boosted their full-year fiscal 2014 projections by the same amount. The stock has climbed 13% since mid-September, despite giving back some ground over the past couple of weeks.|Nike's earnings report from the quarter ended in August sent the stock higher, but it also showed the challenges that the company faces. Nike saw the greatest strength in its North American and European markets, with sales gains in the 8%-10% range. Yet emerging markets, where many retailers have looked for potential growth, saw much weaker results. Overall, Nike's emerging-market revenue rose 5%, but especially disturbing was a 3% drop in sales in the key Chinese space. Still, investors focused on the athletic giant's 38% rise in earnings to send shares higher.|Nike's tenacity in both defending its turf and expanding into lucrative markets has been a key ingredient of its long-term success. For a long time, Adidas has had a commanding position in the global soccer market, but recent efforts from Nike to go after its rival head-on have resulted in market-share gains in the sport, as well as bolstering its overall European sales. With qualifying complete for the 2014 World Cup, Nike and Adidas will spend the next six months battling for position leading up to the tournament in Brazil.|Nike can't afford to let down its guard, though. Under Armour has ambitious plans to continue its impressive growth, looking to relatively untapped markets like women's athletic apparel and innovating with new apparel designs and technology. Adidas has looked to change the complexion of the NBA with new sleeved jerseys that have drawn both praise and criticism from various corners. Yet despite Under Armour's and Adidas' best efforts, Nike continues to make itself attractive to a new generation of shoppers, as high brand loyalty among teens has helped it set the stage for years of future growth.|In the Nike earnings report, watch to see where the company's growth has come from most recently to see whether Adidas or Under Armour are having any effect on the apparel giant's dominance in particular areas. For the most part, though, Nike looks poised to be a solid performer, earning its spot among the Dow Jones Industrials with its continued leadership.|The one area Nike could improveIf there's any complaint that investors have about Nike, it's that the company's 1.2% dividend yield doesn't compete on the income-investing front.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) component rose more than 21% in 2013, underperforming the index, but outperforming competitor Unilever (NYSE: UL) .|Bob McDonald retiresThe single biggest event for Procter & Gamble in 2013 was the resignation of CEO Bob McDonald. Over the course of his tenure as Procter & Gamble's CEO, the company had underperformed its rivals, including Unilever -- a fact reiterated by activist investor Bill Ackman, whose Pershing Square hedge fund holds a stake in the company. In April, Procter & Gamble reported a disappointing quarter: Revenue came in weaker than analysts had expected, while guidance for the future was fairly bleak.|Perhaps because of those disappointing results, Ackman's push for new management was successful. Bob McDonald resigned in May, replaced by former Procter & Gamble CEO AG Lafley, who emerged from retirement. In the past, Lafley had successfully led Procter & Gamble, and though investors shouldn't expect him to remain CEO for too long, he began shaking up the company soon after taking the reins.|Remaking the company for the long termOne of Lafley's first moves was to elevate four senior executives to run major business units and report directly to him. It is widely expected that one of these four will ultimately replace Lafley in the coming years, though the company has yet to set out a definitive succession plan. Other steps have been taken to remake Procter & Gamble -- according to Bloomberg, the company is currently working on a reorganization of its overseas units.|Some of Lafley's changes may have already borne fruit. In Lafley's first quarter back as CEO, Procter & Gamble beat Wall Street analysts' expectations for earnings, and said it expected to grow in 2014. Then, in October, Procter & Gamble posted earnings that were in line with analyst expectations, while it reiterated its previous, positive guidance.|Overall, a solid year for the consumer-products giantUltimately, most investors in Procter & Gamble are likely there for the dividend. That grew in 2013 -- in April, the company announced a 7% increase, the 57th consecutive dividend raise on record. At current levels, Procter & Gamble is currently yielding about 2.90%, and if its ongoing transformation is successful, investors should anticipate another dividend increase in 2014.|Altogether, 2013 was a fairly solid year for the Dow Jones component. Although it underperformed its index, investors were better off holding Procter & Gamble then they were rival Unilever. With Lafley back in charge, Procter & Gamble won't be the same company in future quarters -- whether that results in success or failure, 2013 will stand out as the year the transformation started.

Find out here.|Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and its stock's 12% rise so far this year have fallen short of expectations for 2013, looking particularly anemic against the 21% rises for both the Dow Jones Industrials (INDEX: ^DJI) and industry rival PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). For the first time in its long history, the soft-drink giant has had to deal with serious challenges to its namesake beverage, coming not from successful competitors but rather from health advocates and regulators. Moreover, with international growth having slowed, Coca-Cola faces the burden of restoring consumer confidence in its brand.|Investors aren't used to thinking about Coca-Cola as being vulnerable to changing consumer trends. For the most part, Coca-Cola's long-term strategy has used the stability of its world-renowned brand to stretch its boundaries and to add lucrative new products to an already-solid lineup. Now, the company has to deal with a threat to what has defined it as a company throughout its existence, and the fallout has huge implications for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and the rest of the soft-drink industry, as well as the Dow. Let's take a closer look at Coca-Cola's prospects for 2014.|Are Coca-Cola's growth prospects realistic?Perhaps the most striking thing about Coca-Cola's stock right now is that despite its relatively poor performance and sluggish growth prospects, it still commands a premium earnings multiple. Perhaps because of their perception that the company has limited earnings-growth potential, analysts' target price for Coca-Cola represents only a 12% gain from current levels. Reaching those targets would only result in the stock price rising about $1 above its 2013 highs from last spring.|Coca-Cola will keep facing multiple issues that could hamper its ability to recover and compete more effectively against PepsiCo and its other beverage rivals. Opinion against sugary drinks has gotten extremely negative lately, with the American Heart Association recently publishing a study showing that sugar-sweetened drinks cause 180,000 deaths around the world annually. In response, more U.S. cities and states are considering special taxes on soft drinks in order to discourage consumption. Even some international governments are looking at similar measures in light of obesity concerns.|Coca-Cola can't rely on its carbonated diet drinks to pick up the slack. Consumers have lost confidence in assurances that artificial sweeteners like aspartame are healthy, reducing their consumption of diet beverages and putting pressure on both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Even efforts to use newer alternative sweeteners like stevia might end up failing if Coca-Cola can't convince customers that they're any more reliable from a health standpoint.|Most of these concerns affect PepsiCo as much as Coca-Cola. But Coca-Cola also has some disadvantages that its rival might be able to exploit. PepsiCo used the added leverage provided by its snack-foods division to poach a lucrative Coca-Cola customer, Buffalo Wild Wings,earlier this month. If PepsiCo continues to use the appeal of its popular snack product lines to boost its beverage business, it could spell disaster for the more-concentrated Coca-Cola.|In order to address all these concerns, Coca-Cola announced last week that it would restructure its North American operations. By dividing the region into two parts, Coca-Cola aims to return to its traditional separated structure between production of concentrates and bottling operations. North American bottling operations will report to Coke's Bottling Investments Group while Coca-Cola North America will retain the remainder of the beverage giant's business. As former Americas division President Steve Cahillane left the company as part of the restructuring, analysts now see returning Coca-Cola North America President Sandy Douglas as a potential successor to CEO Muhtar Kent in the future.|Coca-Cola's performance in 2014 both in absolute terms and in relation to the Dow and PepsiCo will depend on its ability to navigate all these issues successfully. By keeping its attention on its long-range vision while adapting its business to meet ongoing concerns, Coca-Cola has the potential to deliver strong results in 2014 and beyond.|Why Coca-Cola has been a huge winner for long-term investorsOne of the dirty secrets that few finance professionals will openly admit is the fact that dividend stocks like Coca-Cola as a group handily outperform their non-dividend paying brethren.

For the first time in its long history, the soft-drink giant has had to deal with serious challenges to its namesake beverage, coming not from successful competitors but rather from health advocates and regulators. Moreover, with international growth having slowed, Coca-Cola faces the burden of restoring consumer confidence in its brand.|Investors aren't used to thinking about Coca-Cola as being vulnerable to changing consumer trends. For the most part, Coca-Cola's long-term strategy has used the stability of its world-renowned brand to stretch its boundaries and to add lucrative new products to an already-solid lineup. Now, the company has to deal with a threat to what has defined it as a company throughout its existence, and the fallout has huge implications for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and the rest of the soft-drink industry, as well as the Dow. Let's take a closer look at Coca-Cola's prospects for 2014.|Are Coca-Cola's growth prospects realistic?Perhaps the most striking thing about Coca-Cola's stock right now is that despite its relatively poor performance and sluggish growth prospects, it still commands a premium earnings multiple. Perhaps because of their perception that the company has limited earnings-growth potential, analysts' target price for Coca-Cola represents only a 12% gain from current levels. Reaching those targets would only result in the stock price rising about $1 above its 2013 highs from last spring.|Coca-Cola will keep facing multiple issues that could hamper its ability to recover and compete more effectively against PepsiCo and its other beverage rivals. Opinion against sugary drinks has gotten extremely negative lately, with the American Heart Association recently publishing a study showing that sugar-sweetened drinks cause 180,000 deaths around the world annually. In response, more U.S. cities and states are considering special taxes on soft drinks in order to discourage consumption. Even some international governments are looking at similar measures in light of obesity concerns.|Coca-Cola can't rely on its carbonated diet drinks to pick up the slack. Consumers have lost confidence in assurances that artificial sweeteners like aspartame are healthy, reducing their consumption of diet beverages and putting pressure on both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Even efforts to use newer alternative sweeteners like stevia might end up failing if Coca-Cola can't convince customers that they're any more reliable from a health standpoint.|Most of these concerns affect PepsiCo as much as Coca-Cola. But Coca-Cola also has some disadvantages that its rival might be able to exploit. PepsiCo used the added leverage provided by its snack-foods division to poach a lucrative Coca-Cola customer, Buffalo Wild Wings,earlier this month. If PepsiCo continues to use the appeal of its popular snack product lines to boost its beverage business, it could spell disaster for the more-concentrated Coca-Cola.|In order to address all these concerns, Coca-Cola announced last week that it would restructure its North American operations. By dividing the region into two parts, Coca-Cola aims to return to its traditional separated structure between production of concentrates and bottling operations. North American bottling operations will report to Coke's Bottling Investments Group while Coca-Cola North America will retain the remainder of the beverage giant's business. As former Americas division President Steve Cahillane left the company as part of the restructuring, analysts now see returning Coca-Cola North America President Sandy Douglas as a potential successor to CEO Muhtar Kent in the future.|Coca-Cola's performance in 2014 both in absolute terms and in relation to the Dow and PepsiCo will depend on its ability to navigate all these issues successfully. By keeping its attention on its long-range vision while adapting its business to meet ongoing concerns, Coca-Cola has the potential to deliver strong results in 2014 and beyond.|Why Coca-Cola has been a huge winner for long-term investorsOne of the dirty secrets that few finance professionals will openly admit is the fact that dividend stocks like Coca-Cola as a group handily outperform their non-dividend paying brethren. The reasons for this are too numerous to list here, but you can rest assured that it's true. However, knowing this is only half the battle.

Suffering from neglect and underinvestment, it agreed to be bought by AT&T in March 2011 for $39 billion. But when that deal got scuppered by the Justice Department, T-Mobile took its $4 billion break-up fee and started shaking up the industry in a very welcome and unexpected manner.|Sprint works with CDMA, some FD-LTE and increasingly TD-LTE. T-Mobile works with GSM, HSPA+ and FD-LTE. Sprint is trying to aggregate the 800, 1900, and 2600 bands; T-Mobile has some 1900, but does a lot of its work on 1700. This merger would result in a horrible technology alphabet soup; there's very little compatible here, which means lots of time and energy will have to be wasted aligning these networks somehow. That means a combined Sprint/T-Mobile will fall even farther behind AT&T and Verizon.|Still, the die has been cast, at this point, and T-Mobile is on a roll. There's something very refreshing about actually paying full price for the phone you use, either up front or on an installment plan, instead of signing up for an overpriced two-year contract and kidding yourself that you're getting the phone for "free" or cheap. Segan calls T-Mobile's Equipment Installment Plan its "one true innovation," because it manages to "bridge the perception gap between the subsidized world and the no-contract world" -- if you're on the plan, you still end up paying less per month than you would on Verizon or AT&T, even with the extra cost of (say) an iPhone 5s added on a separate line item.

Earlier this month, AT&T (NYSE: T) announced that it also wanted to move away from subsidized phones and offer smartphones at full cost with no money down and free financing, which is similar to some of T-Mobile's plans. AT&T customers who have unsubsidized phones or bring their own devices will pay up to $15 less per month on the new plans, an effort to compete more directly with T-Mobile's upfront and low monthly pricing.|AT&T's move shows that T-Mobile has hit on something that resonates with wireless customers, and with the company expanding its network coverage and speeds, T-Mobile's influence could continue to grow.|Foolish final thoughts In the third quarter of this year, T-Mobile added more than 1 million net subscribers, with 643,000 of those being branded postpaid phone net additions. That was the biggest postpaid net customer gain of all the carriers for the second straight quarter, and much higher than AT&T's 363,000 over the same period.

Just last month orders for its next-generation 777X aircraft totaled nearly $100 billion during the Dubai Airshow. That brought the total of Boeing's already massive backlog of orders to more than $500 billion. This provides investors with plenty of transparency and a stable revenue stream in case the company or the economy hit a speed bump, or if Boeing's defense segment declines amid government budget cuts. This week the good news continues for investors: Boeing just announced more plans to return value to shareholders.|Dividend hike As you would expect from any juggernaut company trading in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Boeing's dividend has been extremely consistent. Consistent, that is, until management on Monday announced a 50% quarterly dividend increase to $0.73 per share.|Management also announced that Boeing's board of directors authorized an additional $10 billion for the company's share repurchase program. That authorization will add to the approximately $800 million remaining from its 2007 stock repurchase authorization. The timing and volume of repurchases will be at the discretion of Boeing management over the next two to three years.|If you're worried that Boeing's dividend hike was too much, too fast, don't be. Boeing has a great track record with dividend increases, and this hike will only move its yield from 1.4% to roughly 2.1%. That will cost the company roughly $548 million per quarter, or nearly $2.2 billion per year.|While that's no chump change, Boeing can easily afford the updated dividend payout and share repurchase program. Consider that Boeing is sitting on $10 billion cash as of the third quarter, and nearly $16 billion when you add in marketable securities. That's not even considering the drastic improvement in Boeing's free cash flow over the last five years -- keep in mind 2013's figure below is for the first three quarters only.|Graph by author. Information from Boeing's SEC filings.|Going forward Boeing's massive backlog of orders, focus on returning value to shareholders through dividend hikes and share repurchasing, and improving free cash flow offer plenty to be excited about. However, some investors are still worried Boeing's defense segment will drag it down amid massive federal budget cuts.|Graph by author. Information from Boeing's second-quarter report.|It's easy to forget how much Boeing's commercial aircraft division really dominates its top and bottom lines because its defense segment receives a large amount of attention. The good news is that Boeing's commercial aircraft segment is very healthy and looks to have plenty of growth to overshadow a potential decline in its defense segment.|Consider that Boeing projects the world's commercial airline fleet to double in size over the next two decades. That's an addition of more than 35,000 new airplanes worth roughly $4.8 trillion -- a ridiculously huge chunk of change of which Boeing looks poised to grab more than its fair share.|While some investors let the looming government defense budget cuts, which could slash spending by as much as $1 trillion over the next nine years, scare them from owning Boeing shares, the company has a lot of momentum going forward. Management's move to increase the dividend so drastically and authorize $10 billion in share repurchases shows its confidence in the company's ability to fly higher.|Dividend stocks like Boeing can make you richIt's as simple as that.

After yesterday's close, Dow component Boeing (NYSE: BA) joined the party, announcing it would raise its dividend by half to $0.73 per share and add a $10 billion authorization to its existing share buyback program. In justifying the decision, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said:|Take this year, for example, in which Boeing spent more than it had anticipated to repurchase shares. A year ago to this day, the airplane maker announced it expected to buy $1.5 billion-$2 billion worth of shares in 2013 with its previous authorization; the amount left on that authorization suggests the company bought $2.8 billion worth of shares instead.|Furthermore, Boeing's share repurchase activity appears to have accelerated as the stock price has risen (Boeing shares are up almost 80% year to date). In fact, the company bought no shares during the first quarter and it appears to have waited to make its largest purchases in the fourth quarter -- perhaps as much as $2 billion.|Unless one believes that the shares continue to sell "at a material discount to the company's intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated," that activity suggests a lack of discipline (or understanding) with regard to capital allocation.

This bold move has come as a complete surprise and has resulted in billions of dollars paid in fines. What appears to be brinksmanship is actually based on environmentalism.

Yet, the cost of doing business is the problem -- that soon becomes an invisible hand making FDI (foreign direct investment) through companies like Chevron less likely.|The realities of working in KazakhstanEni and Chevron are no strangers to criticism on its environmental record in Kazakhstan. In 2007 when Karim Masimov become prime minister, he vowed to enforce the rule of law over foreign oil companies. It is easy for a nation to point a finger at foreign companies and then levy a fine or a tax. This is done a lot in the oil business and has become part of the overall cost of doing business. Such practices cause a destabilizing effect within the oil industry.

Over the next decade Chevron's falling existing production, big balance sheet and Mexico's legal reforms will make America's southern neighbor increasingly more attractive.|Smaller independents like Chesapeake and EOG Resources will find Mexico to be a good place to grow after U.S. plays have been developed. Big companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips will not be left out. Given the success they have had U.S. shale formations Mexican shale will not be too risky.

The stock is inexpensive and the threats are overblown, and the recent analyst conference hosted by the company provides two key points which bolster this argument.|The customer is kingWith all of the news that big web companies like Google and Facebook are dumping Cisco and instead buying networking hardware straight from Asia, it's easy to forget that Cisco has a broad customer base which is generally very happy with the relationship.|According to a survey done by ZK research, in October of 2013, 92% of networking customers were not considering changing network hardware vendors in the next year, up from 88% in 2012. Given that Cisco holds a dominant market share in many of its core businesses, this means that most current customers are not considering abandoning Cisco.|Along with this, a study done by Morgan Stanley shows that Cisco is the only major network equipment vendor to see customers consistently increasing their spending plans over the past year. As if October, 35% of Cisco customers planned to increase year-over-year spending by more than 10%, with another 30% of customers planning to increase spending by between 5%-10%.|It's clear that a few large web companies ditching Cisco is not the end of the world, as the rest of the company's customers are staying put -- and, in fact, spending more.|The cloud isn't so great after allOne of the big fears regarding Cisco is how the shift to the cloud will affect the company. Organizations are increasingly moving infrastructure to the cloud, and since the large cloud companies are starting to create custom networking solutions without Cisco, demand for proprietary networking products should logically decline going forward.|However, it's not quite that simple. There seems to be this idea that switching from dedicated servers to a public cloud, like those offered by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Rackspace (NYSE: RAX) , is universally less expensive, but it turns out that's just not true. In Cisco's presentation, it cites an article on Gigaom that analyzes the costs of running dedicated hardware versus various cloud solutions. The results are somewhat shocking.|What does this mean for Cisco? In a lot of cases, it makes no sense for companies to completely move to the cloud, meaning that demand for networking hardware is not going to go away. The cloud complements, but does not completely replace, traditional servers, and this fact alone squashes much of the pessimism surrounding Cisco.|The bottom lineCisco is a classic example of short-term news driving a stock price. While big web companies are bypassing Cisco, the rest of its customers are planning to increase spending on networking hardware, leading me to believe that the current period of weakness will be short-lived. The cloud, while certainly disruptive to many industries, won't affect Cisco as much as some are assuming, and Cisco remains a strong company with a strong future.

Near the end of trading, the Dow is sitting within two points of breakeven, with the majority of its 30 member stocks seeing losses on the day.

Let's check out what you need to know.|Cisco's hot new collabCisco's also on the move today, with the tech stock up around 1.4% so far. The company announced today that it's acquiring start-up software developer Collaborate.com for an undisclosed amount. Cisco hopes the deal will help fuel its push into enterprise workstreams. It's also a mobile play, according to Cisco, helping the company push its software development into tech's hottest growth area.|It's a small but innovative move for Cisco, and one that's promising for shareholders if the company can keep it up. Cisco's been bogged down with sluggish sales growth as of late, as its four largest business units by revenue all experienced slow revenue growth or revenue declines in the firm's most recent quarter. Cisco's strong switching business continues to be the powerhouse of the company, generating a full 40% of Cisco's total revenue. If the company can diversify through niche pickups like Collaborate.com and expand into mobile and other hot fields, it'll be a win for investors in the long term.

As the company known historically for its chemical prowess evolves toward more of an agricultural focus, though, it will face the question of whether it can grow faster than Monsanto (NYSE: MON) and Syngenta (NYSE: SYT) and establish itself as the premier developer of seeds, fertilizer, and other high-margin agricultural products in the industry.|The changing nature of the chemical industry has created a big rift among its various subsectors. On one hand, traditional businesses like titanium dioxide pigment production and other performance chemicals have become commodity-like in their returns, no longer offering the high profit margins that investors prefer. At the other end of the spectrum, the high demand for yield-enhancing crop products, including both seeds with desirable traits engineered into them and fertilizers and pesticides designed to keep crops healthy under challenging conditions, has pushed DuPont further in the direction of Monsanto and Syngenta. Let's take a closer look at DuPont's prospects for 2014.|Stats on DuPont|How far can DuPont grow from here?DuPont stock faces the same challenge as hundreds of other companies after the long bull-market rally, as even solid gains in its fundamentals appear to be almost fully priced into the share price. Based on analysts' current estimates, DuPont has only 5%-6% upside from current price levels, showing that Wall Street doesn't entirely trust the earnings and revenue growth projections that might otherwise justify a higher valuation.|DuPont hopes to use the same general strategy in 2014 that Monsanto did in the past to achieve its high-margin focus. Monsanto used to offer a broader array of chemicals, but nearly all of its revenue now comes from seeds, pesticides, herbicides, and other ag products. A deal between DuPont's Pioneer Seed and Deere (NYSE: DE) to combine Deere's farm-equipment prowess with DuPont seeds will provide farm customers with one-stop assistance in making best use of both companies' products. That could give DuPont a key competitive advantage over Syngenta and Monsanto.|Of course, DuPont will face plenty of challenges. Monsanto recently bought The Climate Corporation, giving it a leadership position in helping farmers evaluate climate conditions to make better choices about which traits to target, as well as ongoing decisions like optimal planting times and crop choices in light of likely weather patterns. Meanwhile, the ongoing controversy over genetically modified organisms will inevitably continue, with Syngenta, Monsanto, and DuPont all likely joining forces to reassure consumers that GMOs aren't a cause for concern on food quality and health issues.|Investors should also remember that DuPont hasn't given up on other promising areas for potentially lucrative products. For instance, as the solar industry gets a new leg up from the popularity of residential installations, DuPont's expertise in developing solar-cell innovations could become more valuable. Bendable and stretchable products could also find use in other applications such as lighting, allowing DuPont to keep its reputation for innovation.|Despite still offering expertise in other areas, DuPont's performance in 2014 will likely depend on its continuing evolution toward becoming increasingly focused on the agricultural industry. As long as farm-commodity prices remain high enough to allow farmers to buy yield-enhancing products affordably, DuPont should keep cashing in on its transformation in 2014 and beyond.|Click here to add DuPont to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks.

"By roughly 2025, natural gas is expected to overtake coal as the second-largest energy source, behind oil," Exxon said in its "Outlook for energy: a view to 2040" published this month.|Shell and Exxon are now among the world's largest gas producers, and both have been quietly lobbying governments in favour of policies that prioritise the use of gas over coal, including carbon pricing and curbs on power plant emissions.|Five of the biggest oil companies (Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell) are among 29 major companies operating in the United States that are planning on the assumption the U.S. government will eventually put a price on carbon, according to the New York Times ("Large companies prepared to pay price on carbon" Dec 5).|As the Times explains: "ExxonMobil is now the nation's biggest natural gas producer, meaning it will stand to profit in a future in which a price is placed on carbon emissions.

But it is losing to the market, and that can't be overlooked. In its most recent quarter, the company grew top-line sales 7.4% over the same quarter last year, and its U.S. stores chalked up 8.2% comps thanks to a slowly but surely improving economy.

And Home Depot's scale is an advantage as well. Its store presence of 2,260 versus the 1,831 for competitor Lowe's affords it more financial resources as well as consistently better margins, which is better for shareholders in the long run.

Yet even the Dow's gains can't keep up with those of many of its members. Take Pfizer: (NYSE: PFE) This Big Pharma standout ranks around the Dow's median among year-to-date performers, but the stock's still gained more than 24% through the year, outpacing the index and delivering great gains to shareholders. How's Pfizer done it? Let's take a walk back through this health care giant's year.|Beating back the patent cliffLike many of its peers in the pharmaceuticals space, Pfizer's had its trouble with the patent cliff lately. The company's cholesterol-fighting powerhouse Lipitor, once one of the top-selling drugs in the world, has taken a beating this year due to losing patent protection in 2012. Lipitor's sales through the first nine months of the year fell off by 49% year over year, and while the drug's still a blockbuster and one of Pfizer's top products by sales, the company and its investors have turned to Lipitor's successors as the fuel that will keep Pfizer running.|It's a good thing, then, that Pfizer's current No. 1 seller, neurological and pain-treatment drug Lyrica, continues to soar. Lyrica racked up more than $3.3 billion in revenue through the first nine months of the year for 10% year-over-year growth, an impressive figure for such a high-sales drug. Pfizer's Celebrex, another top blockbuster, also pulled in strong 8% growth through that time period, while sturdy Enbrel continues to deliver as a cash cow.|Another of Pfizer's best-sellers, the Prevnar vaccine family, has seen revenue slip by 6% this year. Still, these drugs are Pfizer's second-best products by revenue among its current portfolio, and Pfizer won expanded usage for the vaccines in Europe back in July. That should help Prevnar pick up some momentum across the Atlantic, although it hasn't helped Pfizer stave off overall sales declines this year.|Looking to the futureWhile Lyrica and other drugs make up Pfizer's present, it's the future that investors are looking forward to. Pfizer boasts one of the top pipelines in Big Pharma, and while the company hasn't picked up many noteworthy regulatory approvals in the U.S. this year, the pipeline has progressed swimmingly in 2013. As of Nov. 8, Pfizer boasts 20 drugs and projects in phase 3 trials, with another six in registration.|Pfizer's big question going into the year was how drugs approved in the last few years could perform. It's been a mixed bag so far: Pfizer's most promising recently approved drugs, in particular blood thinner Eliquis, which it co-developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) , and immunology therapy Xeljanz, have gotten off to slow starts this year.|Still, Eliquis alone has huge potential. Analysts have pegged Eliquis at generating potentially between $3 billion and $5 billion, and while Pfizer will have to split the bounty with Bristol, it's still a major infusion into the company's future hopes. Xeljanz also looks like a future blockbuster, according to peak sales estimates, and as long as these two budding stars can ramp up momentum, Pfizer will have hit home runs with their approvals.|No shame in a good yearAlthough Pfizer's finances have taken a hit this year, the company's story is similar to many of its rivals across the pharmaceutical industry. The patent cliff's a tough enemy to face, and Pfizer's ability to overcome falling sales from Lipitor while still managing such great stock gains through 2013 is a testament to this company's resilience. With Eliquis, Xeljanz, and other up-and-coming drugs pairing up with a robust pipeline, Pfizer looks like it's in a great place to stay on top of the health care field for years to come.|Looking ahead to 2014's biggest opportunityPfizer's been a success story in 2013, but can it keep up with the market in the new year? The market stormed out to huge gains across 2013, leaving investors on the sidelines burned. However, opportunistic investors can still find huge winners.

Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version in the U.S. on Dec. 11, 2017, almost two and half years before Pfizer's exclusivity expires, the company announced today.|The erectile dysfunction drug has the same active ingredient as Pfizer's heart medication Revatio. The patent on the active ingredient, sildenafil citrate, already expired, but Pfizer received an additional patent on the use of the drug to treat erectile dysfunction, which gives it exclusivity until April 2020.|So-called "method of use" patents are typically hard to defend, but the validity of Pfizer's patent was upheld by a federal judge in 2011.|The settlement removes Pfizer's risk that Teva could win on an appeal and launch immediately. As part of the settlement, Teva will pay Pfizer an undisclosed royalty on the drug, so Pfizer may not give up all that much of its profit on Viagra even if a majority of the patients switch to the generic. When there's only one generic version on the market, the generic drug usually fetches over 90% of the branded drug price.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/17/cash-is-king-for-pfizer.aspx|12/17/2013|0|"Pfizer"|6|Cash Is King for Pfizer|However, cash is important at other times, too. Consider Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) , which generates large amounts of cash and is arguably the king of its sector.|Indeed, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company and sells a vast range of drugs, including some that you've seen at the local pharmacy and many others that are specialist, prescription-only drugs.|Of course, Pfizer is 150 years old and so is a mature business operating in a very mature market, so high levels of free cash flow are perhaps to be expected.|However, what's impressive about Pfizer is that its free cash flow yield (free cash flow as a proportion of its market capitalization) is just over 8%, which is extremely high. This indicates that Pfizer offers good value at current levels, and, in addition, this level of free cash flow is unlikely to be a one-off event, since the company should be relatively stable in future years as it brings new drugs onto the pipeline while others go off-patent.|The big question, though, is whether Pfizer is doing the right things with its cash.|In AstraZeneca's case, it paid out 58% of free cash flow as dividends last year, which trumps Pfizer even though AstraZeneca is going through a more difficult time with regard to its "patent cliff." Sure, Pfizer has had issues of its own on this front, dealing with many of its key drugs coming off-patent, but it has dealt relatively well with the situation overall.|AstraZeneca, on the other hand, has struggled until this year to get its act together and build an encouraging pipeline. Yet it is still more generous with its cash than Pfizer.|Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline paid out 115% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, although it hasn't experienced the issues with its drug pipeline that AstraZeneca or Pfizer have. Such a level is unsustainable in the long run, but it shows how generous GlaxoSmithKline is compared with Pfizer.|Despite this relatively low payout ratio, Pfizer still offers a yield of 3.2% and has a great pipeline of drugs, where significant progress has been made in the past couple of years as the company refocuses its efforts on drug development rather than on consumer brands.|Although a higher yield would be great for shareholders, Pfizer still offers great value (as shown by the free cash flow yield), relatively stable cash flow, the potential for positive drug pipeline developments, and an above-average dividend yield.|Cash is Kkng. On that basis, Pfizer still seems to be the (somewhat ungenerous) king.

This is a key win for PepsiCo, as Buffalo Wild Wings is a fast-growing restaurant chain. For Buffalo Wild Wings, it's a win as well for a number of reasons, including PepsiCo's sponsorship of the NFL and Major League Baseball. The only loser in this deal appears to be Coca-Cola.|Plenty of possibilitiesThere are plenty of possibilities for Buffalo Wild Wings with PepsiCo as its beverage supplier instead of Coca-Cola. In addition to having Pepsi products, including Mountain Dew, 7UP, and Tropicana orange juice, PepsiCo also offers its line of Frito-Lay potato chips. This gives Buffalo Wild Wings endless possibilities to create plenty of new snack options.|What about Coca-Cola?I won't be bringing out the tissues for Coca-Cola; after all, the company remains the No. 1 beverage company in the world. While PepsiCo has diversified itself with its snacks business, Coca-Cola is purely a beverage company. In addition to its namesake brand, Coca-Cola owns Sprite, Fanta, Dasani, Vitaminwater, Minute Maid, Powerade and many others.|For Coca-Cola, its strategy is to ensure it remains dominant in the beverage business. While some have said that the single-serve business from the likes of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters poses a threat to its business, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent sees things differently. At this month's Beverage-Digest conference, he said that he sees single-serve dispensers as an opportunity and not a threat. Coca-Cola getting into the single-serve market could certainly be an exciting opportunity for the company.|How do shares look?In the past year, the biggest disappointment has been Coca-Cola. Its shares have risen only 4%. The best performer has been Buffalo Wild Wings, whose shares have risen 92%. PepsiCo shares have risen slightly more than 17% in the past year.|Buffalo Wild Wings trades at 30 times next year's earnings. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both trade at 17 times next year's earnings. Both also have the same dividend yield of 2.8%.|It's tougher to decide who the winner is between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo overall. The beverage business is extremely competitive. While PepsiCo won the battle for Buffalo Wild Wings, there are plenty of other battles where Coca-Cola is winning. This is just one of many battles that the two giants are fighting in the "cola wars."|Both companies look attractive from a value investor's point of view with their solid dividend and low P/E ratio. I'd say an investor can't go wrong in owning either PepsiCo or Coca-Cola for the long run.|Mark Yagalla has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Amazon's earnings have been artificially depressed in recent years due to the company's heavy investment in a variety of areas. While earnings should rebound in the next five years, bulls are overestimating just how profitable Amazon will be.|However, it's worth noting that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is already a dominant force in global retail today, with annual revenue approaching $500 billion (more than six times higher than that of Amazon). Yet its market cap is only slightly higher than Amazon's, at around $250 billion.|Considering that it will take well more than a decade for Amazon to reach Wal-Mart's current scale, Amazon's valuation only makes sense if it will ultimately become much bigger than Wal-Mart. While that's certainly possible, it's hardly guaranteed. E-commerce does not work well in every category where Wal-Mart competes. Furthermore, Amazon's revenue growth has already slowed significantly in the last two years, calling into question its "infinite" growth potential.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/17/why-wal-mart-target-and-costco-are-appealing-inves.aspx|12/17/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|1|Why Wal-Mart, Target, and Costco Are Appealing Investments|As you might already know, retailers have adopted highly promotional strategies recently. This isn't just the case for apparel retailers, it is also true for big-box retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) as well. While Wal-Mart offers everyday low prices, it adds deals on top of those prices in order to drive more people to its stores. The idea is that those promotions will lead to visitors spending on nonpromotional items as well.|With a profit margin of 3.62%, it might seem as though Wal-Mart's profits could be in danger. However, the company does so much volume (245 million customers per week) that its profit margin isn't a big concern. Contrary to popular belief, Wal-Mart's margin is also higher than Target's profit margin of 3.27%.|Highly promotionalWal-Mart recently announced record Black Friday results. Logically, it decided to offer a Black Friday redux. This is the way Wal-Mart management operates, and it's one of the reasons you shouldn't jump on the "I Hate Wal-Mart" bandwagon. Wal-Mart is always going to find ways to win, or at least give itself the best chance to win. In this case, it's offering price drops on select items through the store from Dec. 13 to Dec. 24.|Wal-Mart is also wise to make this move because according to ShopperTrak, four of the 10 busiest shopping days of the year were between Dec. 20 and Dec. 24, with Super Saturday -- that will be December 21 this year -- being the second busiest behind Black Friday.|Wal-Mart also held a Special Super Savings event on Dec. 16, where 300 items throughout the store were discounted further. In addition to that, Wal-Mart will offer free shipping on all items if you spend $35 or more online. You can also pick up your items at the store. Then there's the ad price match. If you bring your Wal-Mart receipt and prove that you found the item cheaper elsewhere, you will get a Wal-Mart gift card for the difference in price.|Promotional impactAll of these promotions will likely lead to increased sales and contracting margins. The latter might affect the bottom line, but remember that Wal-Mart is a massive cash flow generator. In fact, it generated $23 billion in operating cash flow over the past year. Therefore, it can buy back shares with ease, which can offset bottom-line declines. It can also increase its dividend. Currently, Wal-Mart yields 2.40%.|As far as growth potential, keep an eye on Wal-Mart expanding its small-box store count from 300 to 550-plus over the next 18 months. Consider the following quote from Wal-Mart CEO Bill Simon:|Against a dollar store, [Wal-Mart Express stores] have fresh food, pharmacy and gas and perform really, really well and have a pricing advantage. Against drug they have a significant pricing advantage and they have fresh food and gasoline. And then against small grocery stores we have a competitive price advantage.|Target isn't quite as promotional as Wal-Mart, but it lags Wal-Mart in operating cash flow by a wide margin, as it generated $6.73 billion over the past year. This is still a massive number, and Target currently yields a more generous 2.70%. However, Target is likely to use much of its cash flow for Canadian expansion. Imagine Wal-Mart before it expanded across the United States. While not on the same scale, Target has similar potential throughout Canada.|As far as Costco goes, it generated $3.44 billion in operating cash flow over the past year and it currently yields 1%. Furthermore, it's trading at 22 times forward earnings, which makes it more expensive than Wal-Mart and Target, trading at 14 and 13 times earnings, respectively. Also keep in mind the profit margin differences above. All that said, Costco is growing the fastest:|The bottom lineIf you're looking for safety in an uncertain economic environment where you can reap the benefits of stock buybacks and generous dividends, then Wal-Mart should be considered. If you're looking for more growth potential thanks to international expansion, take a look at Target or Costco. They're likely to present a little more risk since they don't generate as much cash flow, but that's only relatively speaking.

Clearly, AT&T and Verizon will loom large in the picture.Ciena's management declared that it felt "very positive around what's happening in North America", and of the major carriers "said simply, we will do more business with them in 2014 than we did with them in 2013."|In addition, AT&T's spending is also somewhat contingent on how quickly its project VIP (a plan to 4G/LTE to 300 million points of presence, or POPs, by 2015) will progress. At the time of its recent results in October, AT&T looked to be well ahead of plan with 250 million POPs already achieved. It's reasonable to expect spending to be tempered in accordance with where it is in the plan, but AT&T also announced that it was " strengthening our financial structure and our balance sheet to give us the ability to invest and maintain financial flexibility". Companies don't do such things when they are inclined to slow long-term spending.

The Justice Department blocked an attempt by AT&T to acquire T-Mobile in 2011, calling the latter an "aggressive competitor" that keeps the other three major carriers honest on pricing.|Combined, Sprint and T-Mobile would boast 98 million subscribers, where AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) respectively have 108 million and 101 million. That has the looks of an oligopoly; however, those numbers understate AT&T and Verizon's heft. Once you look at postpaid customers -- the most lucrative segment -- the balance of power looks different. Sprint and T-Mobile together can muster up 53 million postpaid customers, but that would still leave them some ways behind Verizon Wireless (95 million) and AT&T (72 million).|In that context, the odds of a deal at this stage look pretty speculative. That's a shame -- given the massive investments required in network infrastructure and spectrum, a combined Sprint-T-Mobile would likely be a more effective competitor to AT&T and Verizon, which currently account for nearly all of the U.S. industry's profits.

Several analysts said they believed Sprint leaked the story to test regulators' reception to a potential deal. The Department of Justiceand the Federal Communications Commissionboth opposed AT&T's $39 billion plan to acquire T-Mobile in 2011. A Sprint takeover of T-Mobile, while potentially less anticompeitive than AT&T's, would have nonetheless raised serious concerns, analysts said Monday.|Noting that Sprint and T-Mobile are the No. 3 and No. 4 number carriers, respectively, in the U.S. wireless market after AT&T and Verizon, they said the DOJ's Antitrust Division is likely to challenge the deal in court.|Kingand Kaut also noted that T-Mobile, flush with cash from the $3 billion breakup fee it got from AT&T two years ago, gained more market share than any other wireless carrier in 2013. T-Mobile's moves this year included acquiring MetroPCS Communications."Thus, we believe it's possible [a] merger with Sprint may face an even steeper uphill climb in the DOJ's eyes than in April."|Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, agreed that the deal would face likely opposition from regulators. The likely defense from the companies that they would be able to "form a more effective counterweight to Verizon and AT&T ... is a solid argument" but not one ultimately likely to prevail. "Despite being a more palatable merger than AT&T/T-Mobile on pure antitrust grounds, we believe a Sprint/T-Mobile tie-up probably would face the same fate - a challenge by DOJ and the FCC. We believe regulators are very pleased with T-Mobile's resurgence and its aggressive, innovative moves and would not want to see it disappear via acquisition." --By Bill McConnell in Washington.

Yet even though Exxon and rival BP (NYSE: BP) spent most of the year trying to catch up to fellow oil giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , a recent rebound suggests Exxon might be the company to beat in 2014.|For consumers who've paid high prices at the pump for gas for years, the troubles that ExxonMobil has had to deal with might seem trivial. Yet even though relatively high oil prices have supported the use of unconventional production methods like hydraulic fracturing to help Exxon, Chevron, and BP boost their overall production, Exxon in particular still has to work hard just to keep its massive output totals from following the natural rate of decline of its existing wells. Yet could favorable conditions in the natural-gas market help boost Exxon's fortune in the coming year? Let's take a closer look at ExxonMobil's prospects for 2014.|Exxon faces what could be a tough environment for oil prices in 2014. Even though the International Energy Agency boosted its 2014 projections for global oil demand last week, the opening of Iranian oil exports following the oil-producing giant's agreement on nuclear issues could add even more supply to the market. As a result, a number of commodities analysts have come out with bearish calls for crude prices, with Barclays forecasting a drop in Brent crude to $101 per barrel and Deutsche Bank following suit with a call for $98 Brent and $89 West Texas Intermediate prices. Obviously, those calls hurt Chevron and BP just as much as they would Exxon.|Still, production is an important consideration. BP has moved back into the Gulf of Mexico in search of greater production, working with Exxon on the Thunder Horse platform, which is BP's largest producing deepwater field. Meanwhile, Chevron sees boosting production by 700,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, more than a quarter above current levels. Exxon will have to work hard to keep production up by capitalizing on areas like the Arctic without sacrificing its historical discipline to do projects only if they produce adequate returns on capital.|Yet what many people neglect to consider about Exxon is its big presence in the natural-gas business. Highly successful liquefied natural gas export terminals built in conjunction with Qatar Petroleum have demonstrated Exxon's leadership in the LNG industry, even as Chevron aims to ramp up its own LNG presence in order to maximize the value of its massive nat-gas finds in western Australia. Closer to home, U.S. natural gas prices have soared recently, although much of the spike came from cold weather that caused a typical knee-jerk reaction higher. Nevertheless, Exxon stands to gain a lot if the rise becomes permanent, with hopes that its acquisition of XTO Energy four years ago will eventually prove to have been a visionary move.|In the end, ExxonMobil's performance in 2014 will rely on the company's ability to keep production volumes up and on global markets for crude oil, natural gas, and refined energy products. If a recovering economy boosts demand, even the pace of new finds across the industry might be insufficient to keep prices from defying analysts' expectations and climbing higher. That could produce Exxon's best chance to beat out Chevron and BP in 2014, as long as Exxon's share of acquiring lucrative new energy opportunities bests those of its rivals.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/16/now-is-the-time-to-buy-cisco.aspx|12/16/2013|0|"Cisco Systems"|2|Now Is the Time to Buy Cisco|It's difficult to be an investor in Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) these days. After the company guided for a revenue decline of up to 10% for the current quarter, the stock slumped. Shares then slipped further as Cisco was downgraded by an analyst at Citi, with possible share loss to competitors Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) and Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU) , along with an embrace of non-proprietary solutions, cited as the main reasons.|Cisco took yet another hit on Dec. 12 when the company lowered its growth outlook for the next 3-5 years. Previously targeting 5%-7% annual revenue growth, the company is now shooting for 3%-6% annual revenue growth, while expecting the current fiscal year, which ends in July, to show a 4% revenue decline. Shares of Cisco are now about 23% below the 52-week high, and the barrage of bad news seems like it will never end.|Competition is not newCisco has been able to achieve above-average margins over the past decade for a reason. This reason is not lack of competition, as competitors like Juniper and Alcatel have been trying to chip away at the Cisco juggernaut the whole time.|The fact that these companies have some new products on the market, temporarily winning some market share, is not a good reason to write off Cisco altogether. There are significant switching costs for customers of Cisco's core network switch and routing businesses, and there's no real reason to believe that Cisco is in danger of losing its competitive advantages.|One area of concern is the rise of software-defined networking, which threatens the proprietary hardware sold by Cisco. Alcatel recently launched new SDN technologies for its line of enterprise switches, allowing for increased programmability of enterprise networks. Juniper announced a similar initiative in October, makings its line of MX routers "SDN-ready," as the company put it. Cisco, after initially balking at SDN, recently launched its Insieme line of switches. Insieme allows for a high level of programmability while still requiring proprietary hardware from Cisco, offering a sort of hybrid SDN solution.|How big of a threat is an open question, but it seems like only very large companies like Google, which has massive networking needs, can feasibly bypass Cisco and the rest. Losing big customers is certainly not a good thing, but Cisco's dominance doesn't look to be going away anytime soon. Customers without the resources of Google don't have much choice.|Extreme pessimismAt the end of trading on Dec. 12, shares of Cisco were priced at about $20.50. The company has a little more than $6 per share in net cash, leaving an enterprise value of about $14.50 per share. That's just 7.8 times fiscal 2013 earnings.|Of course, with revenue set to decline in the current fiscal year, profits will likely fall as well, so the forward ratio is probably a bit higher. There are two ways to think about Cisco. The first is to assume that the problems the company is facing are permanent, and that Cisco won't be able to compete with new technologies. The second is to assume that any issues that Cisco is having are temporary, and that the company will return to revenue and EPS growth in the next few years, albeit slow growth. If you believe the second statement, then the stock is outrageously inexpensive.|The bottom lineUnless you think that Cisco's core business is going to completely collapse, the stock is simply too cheap to ignore. I think that people overestimate the effects of disruptive technologies just as often as they underestimate them. In this case, the level of pessimism surrounding Cisco just doesn't match up with reality.

AT&T and Verizon may pause spending on Ciena's solutions, but they still need to invest in the near term.|Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported a weak set of results recently and gave even poorer guidance, so telco investors must have had a certain amount of trepidation over Ciena's (NASDAQ: CIEN) earnings. In the end, Ciena's recent fourth-quarter revenue topped analysts' expectations, but missed on earnings. In addition, the guidance was slightly weaker than analysts expected. The market immediately sold the stock off. Does this mean the telco industry is set for another year of AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) trying to ruthlessly cut back on expenditures? And is Ciena's status as the "go-to" play in telco under threat?|Ciena misses, but not by muchThe "Cisco effect" was always going to hang over Ciena, but the market looks to have been a little harsh in marking Ciena down nearly 7% after the results. While revenue of $583.4 million was ahead of estimates, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.16 was below analyst estimates of $0.24. Moreover, the midpoint of its first quarter revenue guidance of $515 million to $545 million was below analyst's consensus of $537.7 million. Time to get nervous?|And finally, don't read too much into the Cisco-Ciena analogy. Cisco saw specific weakness in emerging market spending, and has a far greater exposure to older technology spending than Ciena does. In fact, Ciena's great strength is its exposure to next-gen networking technologies like 40G and 100G Ethernet networking and Optical Transport Networks. So while Cisco is exposed to overall telco capital expenditures, Ciena can prosper as long as telcos are spending in the areas where Ciena is strongest.

In contrast to Cisco, Ciena's management declared itself "encouraged by markets like Brazil, and India, and Russia, and the Middle East."|Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported a weak set of results recently and gave even poorer guidance, so telco investors must have had a certain amount of trepidation over Ciena's (NASDAQ: CIEN) earnings.

With IBM (NYSE: IBM) , Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and other tech titans fighting to take maximum advantage of favorable trends in enterprise software, cloud computing, virtualization, and data analytics, Oracle has faced more competition than ever.|Many ordinary Americans aren't all that familiar with Oracle because its software offerings tend to focus not on consumer-oriented applications but rather on businesses. Its acquisition of Sun Microsystems several years ago only heightened Oracle's grip on the business community, and the company has worked hard to develop the software-as-a-service business model to enhance its profits and create recurring streams of revenue that investors can rely on. But with incursions from IBM and Cisco added to the perennial attempts of smaller companies to rise to Oracle's stature, the question investors face is whether Oracle can keep leading the industry forward in the direction of its choosing. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Oracle over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|As much attention as IBM and Cisco have gotten, Oracle faces big challenges from smaller players. For instance, Workday and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) established a partnership in order to combine their respective management-software strengths in the hopes of providing lower-cost solutions to cost-conscious enterprise customers. Those efforts continue despite the fact that Salesforce has its own partnership with Oracle to encourage joint use of their offerings. Meanwhile, Splunk has challenged both IBM and Oracle in the data-analytics space, marking the trend toward nimble small competitors able to react more quickly and efficiently to rapid changes in the tech industry than large monolithic companies like Oracle.|Oracle's challenges aren't unique, as Cisco Systems and IBM have both faced many of the same issues. Cisco in particular has suffered from dire warnings from CEO John Chambers, who has repeatedly discussed the potential for weaker results than investors had hoped to see. In Oracle's case, on the other hand, CEO Larry Ellison has raised controversy due to his high pay and his absence from last quarter's earnings call due to Oracle's entry in the America's Cup yacht race.|In the Oracle earnings report, watch to see how Ellison responds to criticism, and more importantly how the company will work harder to differentiate itself from Cisco and IBM as they all compete for the same business. Either way, investors need to expect a cutthroat battle among tech's titans in 2014 and beyond.|Fool contributor Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Nevertheless, Exxon stands to gain a lot if the rise becomes permanent, with hopes that its acquisition of XTO Energy four years ago will eventually prove to have been a visionary move.|In the end, ExxonMobil's performance in 2014 will rely on the company's ability to keep production volumes up and on global markets for crude oil, natural gas, and refined energy products. If a recovering economy boosts demand, even the pace of new finds across the industry might be insufficient to keep prices from defying analysts' expectations and climbing higher. That could produce Exxon's best chance to beat out Chevron and BP in 2014, as long as Exxon's share of acquiring lucrative new energy opportunities bests those of its rivals.|Is Exxon your only smart play in energy?Exxon is at the center of the revolution in the United States' energy position, and finding smart stocks to profit from historic levels of investment is essential.

Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to a buy rating today, asserting shares will be worth $109 in a year.|When looking at today's pop, remember that Wall Street analysts not only have little incentive to get their calls right, they also have a terrible history of underperforming the market. So, let's take a look at ExxonMobil's trends to see where the company is going operationally to see if Goldman Sachs may be right.|Over the past five years, ExxonMobil's revenue has fallen 7% and net income is down 24.4%. The primary reasons are falling consumption of oil in developed countries and a sharp rise in the cost of producing oil, two trends that aren't slowing anytime soon.|The third quarter was the first time in two-and-a-half years that ExxonMobil was able to increase production of oil and gas. But as you can see above, that did not result in additional profit. Goldman Sachs is predicting that this production growth will continue and will help grow revenue for the company.|Production may grow, but keep in mind that costs are rising because producing oil is getting more expensive and that there's nothing suggesting that oil prices will rise significantly in the near future. Those two trends mean that margins will continue to be squeezed in the long term. I'm not saying ExxonMobil's stock can't or won't go up next year, just that operationally there are a lot of risks, some of which we're already seeing play out.

First, in support of his thesis, Cramer cited gains in Exxon, which he believes has become very desirable and should remain desirable even if headwinds begin the blow.|Part of the increased demand for Exxon stems from improved production growth as well as better refining spreads.

Let's check out what you need to know.|Exxon's picking up steam today not because of any economic report, but because Goldman Sachs offered an upgrade for the stock, raising its opinion from neutral to buy. It seems good timing on Goldman's part: Exxon's stock has struggled through a ho-hum year, picking up only about 8% year to date as the company's downstream earnings have fallen substantially through the first nine months of the year. Nevertheless, Exxon's not going anywhere: Despite the company's financial falls in 2013, Exxon remains one of the biggest and most far-reaching companies in the energy business. Goldman said the stock looks inexpensive and that a production turnaround could be on the way; if it's right, 2014 could be a big year for investors in this Big Oil giant.|The stock potential you can't ignore in 2014Exxon-Mobil's a good stock, but there's a huge difference between a good stock, and a stock that can make you rich.

A prime example of this is Home Depot (NYSE: HD) , which might be a massive company, but if you look just at the numbers, you might think this was a small growth stock.|Up 25% and still relatively cheap?It's amazing that a company as well-known as Home Depot could be under-appreciated, but just a couple of years ago there were rumors that this company's fast growth days could be over. With the stock up roughly 25% in the last year, investors have already been treated to excellent returns.|Some might say that Home Depot's competitor Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) is stuck playing from behind. Lowe's hasn't been able to keep up based on revenue or same-store sales with its more well-known competitor. In addition, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has slowly but surely expanded its home-improvement selection, but the company is growing fastest in the grocery space and isn't as concerned with trying to take over Home Depot's turf.|The first reason investors should consider Home Depot is that the combination of the company's 2% yield and nearly 18% annual growth that analysts expect in the next five years gives investors the best combination of total return. While some might make the argument that Lowe's 1.5% yield and slightly more than 18% annual growth expectations create an equal value, the company's results have been more inconsistent.|While Wal-Mart has a yield of 2.5%, the company's expected earnings-per-share growth in the next few years is only expected to come in at slightly more than 9%. Given that all three companies trade for forward P/E ratios in the teens, the consistency and speed of Home Depot's growth in revenue and earnings is hard to ignore.|No comp-arisonWhile analysts' projections are not always correct, it's easier to compare Home Depot's comparable-store-sales growth to its peers. While Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer, the company's expansion into grocery sales and sheer size have caused its comparable-store sales to slow.|In the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart reported same-store sales decreased domestically by 0.3%. Of course, Wal-Mart's greater size and lower exposure to faster-growing segments like home improvement and clothing have hurt the company's results. Where Lowe's and Home Depot are concerned, both benefited from an improvement in the housing industry; Lowe's performed well with a 6.2% increase in comps, but Home Depot did even better with a 7.4% increase.|Not surprisingly, Lowe's CEO Robert Niblock said, "The home improvement industry is poised for persisting growth." Voicing a similar sentiment, Frank Blake, CEO of Home Depot, said, "Our third quarter results reflect the continuing improvement in the housing market." With the tailwind of a stronger housing market behind it, Home Depot should continue to benefit and report strong comparable-store-sales growth.

That's exactly what JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JMP) (NYSE: JMP) (NYSE: JMP) just did. Instead of sitting back and letting virtual currencies slowly but surely cement their position in the market for online payments, the firm decided to take matters into its own hands.|Taking actionJPMorgan proposes a computer-implemented method of making payments anonymously "without provision of an account number or name from the payer." It includes digital wallets, "web cash," and the ability to transfer funds virtually to anyone as easily and quickly as sending an email. Does any of this sound familiar? Isn't that what Bitcoin -- the controversial "crypto-currency" does?|JPMorgan's payment system introduces a Payment Portal Processor, or PPP, enhanced electronic wallet with special credit push and form filling features. It's designed to enrich the e-commerce experience by enabling consumers to shop on the web without pausing to fill out lengthy forms with personal financial and shipping information. This will be done automatically.|However, payments will still be processed through the existing Electronic Transfer Fund networks we use to pay for stuff online. Also, JPMorgan's e-wallets will be stored on a "host web server," presumably under the bank's control. Bitcoin, on the other hand, thrives on decentralization by relying on peer-to-peer exchanges.|And Bitcoin transactions are stored on Blockchain, the record keeper shared by all nodes participating in the Bitcoin protocol-based system. That's what makes this digital currency revolutionary. Will JPMorgan manage to steal its thunder?|Is it too late?The filing is actually a renewal of a patent that has been gathering dust for more than 10 years. And it will probably take some time for JPMorgan to turn this so-called "new paradigm" into reality. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is making headway on multiple fronts.|"Every day somebody comes in and says, Bitcoin is going to be as big as the Internet," says Chris Dixon, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Is JPMorgan a day late and a dollar short?|Who holds all the cards?JPMorgan is the largest nationally chartered bank. In other words, the Fed can stick its nose in the bank's business. However, this could be a double-edge sword. Bitcoin made a name by staving off any kind of government intervention. That's something America's largest bank by assets can't do.|If we read between the lines, what is the gist? Do Bernanke's words mean that regulators would be more than willing to, in some way, foster a new online payment system that it could keep tabs on? If JPMorgan provides consumers with a viable alternative to credit card fees and existing virtual cash, won't then the world's most controversial digital currency lose its mojo?|Final thoughtNo matter what the outcome may be, the encrypted online currency is doing what it's supposed to do. It's driving innovation in behalf of a financial system that's pretty much outdated. If Bitcoin hadn't made waves, who knows when and if JPMorgan would pursue this game-changing patent.|JP Morgan's patent application has already been denied partly because it seems to be a clone of Bitcoin. Even if they did manage to get their own payment system up, it would lack Bitcoin's biggest advantage of being decentralized.

A share-price return of 48.64% year to date makes the athletic apparel maker the second-best Dow stock, behind only Boeing's 79.18% gain in 2013 and just ahead of American Express'47.3% rise. The chart below shows how Nike compared to the Dow and S&P 500 since Jan. 1.|As you can see from the chart, Nike clobbered both the Dow and the S&P 500 this year. Nike's share price tracked the indexes fairly closely throughout the year. Similar peaks and valleys can be seen across the time frame, except for two big divergences; the first came in late March after Nike's performance had lagged the indexes for a few weeks, then in September Nike pulled away from the market's slow rise. So what happened at those times? Let's take a look.|The first big jump came on March 22 after the company reported earnings. As my colleague Jeremy Bowman said at the time, Nike was playing above the rim that day -- shares rose more than 12% at one point during trading. The company reported earnings-per-share growth of 20%, revenue growth of 9% during the quarter, and a big gain after selling its Cole Haan brand for $203 million. Additionally, the company reported strong growth in North America and Europe, while China and other parts of Asia struggled. This was largely seen as good news because the U.S. is still Nike's largest market and primary source of profit.|The move in September can be contributed to two things. First, on Sept. 10, the Dow Jones announced that it had chosen Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa to replace Bank of America, Alcoa, and Hewlett-Packard among the index's 30 members. This announcement affected the stock price because it meant that some funds now had to buy Nike shares to meet their guidelines. For example, your average Dow Jones index fund is required to hold all 30 of the stocks on the index. Being added to the Dow instantly increased the demand for Nike shares and thus the stock price rose.|Nike also delivered a strong fiscal first quarter earnings release on Sept. 26, reporting that it increased revenue by 8% during the period and earnings per share by 54%. The results were a sign that the competition wasn't hurting business. The stock jumped 4.7% after the earnings announcement and moved above $70 per share, where it remains today.|Looking down the road, Nike can be expected to continue to perform well and produce strong returns for shareholders, but perhaps not as strong as what we saw in 2013. The move to the Dow was a big win for the company and shareholders, but that sort of thing doesn't happen every year.|The Motley Fool recommends Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Lululemon Athletica, Nike, Under Armour, and Visa.

While Nike and Adidas are the established players in this market, Under Armour has slowly but steadily been gaining a foothold and has been the best performing stock of the three this year.|However, for attaining almost a five-fold jump in revenue by 2020, Under Armour must take away market share from Nike, Adidas, and others. Nike is the world leader in the athletic-footwear market with a share of close to 50%, and despite its size, it still manages to grow.|Fighting with the big boysIn the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Nike posted a revenue gain of 8% versus the same quarter a year ago to $7 billion. Nike must keep an eye on Under Armour as its smaller rival is aggressively pushing its marketing budget, which, as a percentage of revenue, equaled that of Nike's last year.|Nike has yet to see success in China, where the athletic-apparel and footwear market is estimated to reach $32 billion by 2017. Its frustration continues as it faces competition from brands like Li Ning and Peak. Nike's sales of footwear items were down 7%, leading to a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue from China. In contrast, even a smaller company like Skechers reported a triple-digit sales jump in China. Nike is trying to reset this trend going forward by focusing on delivering products that Chinese consumers want.|In addition, the sales of TaylorMade-adidas Golf declined by 16% due to weakness in demand, as per the company report. This, however, seems to be Adidas-specific, as Nike did not report any such weakness.|Under Armour would aim to turn Nike's weakness into its own advantage in China and take inspiration from a smaller player such as Skechers. So, Under Armour is looking promising and its annual earnings growth forecast of 21.6% for the next five years also looks good. Hence, investors on the lookout for an aggressive play in the athletic-footwear and apparel industry should definitely consider Under Armour for their portfolio.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/16/why-sodastream-popped-14-in-2013.aspx|12/16/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|2|Home-carbonation manufacturer SodaStream (NASDAQ: SODA) has posted modest gains of about 14% so far in 2013, but investors have to be somewhat disappointed given the stock's much more extensive gains earlier in the year. Even though the company has done a good job of capitalizing on some of the negatives affecting big-name soda makers Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) , SodaStream stock hasn't responded well to trends over the second half of 2013. Can SodaStream regain its positive momentum, or will it turn out to have been the fad-based company that so many bearish investors have said it was all along? Let's take a closer look at the ups and downs of SodaStream this year and whether its stock will rise in 2014.|Backing up SodaStream's gains were strong fundamentals. In May, the company announced quarterly results that included revenue gains of 34%, which helped push earnings up 20%. Both figures were higher than investors had expected, and particularly encouraging was the fact that consumables like carbon-dioxide gas canisters and soda flavors saw sales grow at a faster pace than soda makers. In particular, SodaStream has done a good job of playing up its environmental and health angles compared to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.|Yet the key competitive advantage that SodaStream has over Coca-Cola and PepsiCo is a far superior growth outlook, despite recent concerns. With the major beverage makers suffering concerns over potential obesity-related regulation and taxation both in the U.S. and in other areas around the world, SodaStream's shares might well be the best bargain you'll find this holiday season -- especially if flavor-syrup sales bounce back from their recent slump.

Word broke that Intel and Verizon were in talks over this same deal in October. However, the latest reports claim Intel selling its TV upstart to Verizon is nearing its final stages and could close as early as next week.|How Intel's OnCue could change the cable industryOn the surface, Verizon appears to gain the most in this deal, as Intel's OnCue could be a potential game changer in the U.S. cable market when placed in the right hands. The key here is the technology that powers Intel's OnCue and how it drastically differs from the typical cable distribution model.|Said another way, having access to OnCue's innovative technology would allow Verizon (or any other company with a similar technology) to offer its cable service to anywhere where an Internet connection exists.|Move along IntelThe primary reason OnCue makes sense in Verizon's hands and not Intel's comes down to content. Although it could require them to renegotiate some of their content deals (this isn't totally clear yet), Verizon already has deals in place with the content providers. It already pays studios and networks billions of dollars in licensing fees to distribute content through its FiOS cable service.|So at the end of the day, this deal really comes down to fit for both Intel and Verizon. Although OnCue clearly holds plenty of potential, but it simply makes far more sense under Verizon's corporate umbrella than Intel's.|As of right now, this deal has yet to close. But for the reasons discussed above, it's clear it makes plenty of sense for both Intel and Verizon.

Dow component Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) led the index higher.|Verizon said to be considering Internet TV bidVerizon shares weren't up nearly as much as iRobot's, but investors were still enjoying a nice gain of more than 1%. Verizon may have just been trading higher in line with the broader market, but news of a forthcoming move into Internet-based TV could have helped support shares.|Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon could buy Intel's fledgling Internet TV operation for less than $200 million. Verizon was widely expected to buy the unit after the chip maker made it clear that it was no longer interested in the business, but some reports had put the figure closer to $500 million. While the deal wouldn't dramatically change Verizon's larger wireless business, it could help the company strengthen its push into paid-TV and Internet video content.

In addition, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has slowly but surely expanded its home-improvement selection, but the company is growing fastest in the grocery space and isn't as concerned with trying to take over Home Depot's turf.|While Wal-Mart has a yield of 2.5%, the company's expected earnings-per-share growth in the next few years is only expected to come in at slightly more than 9%. Given that all three companies trade for forward P/E ratios in the teens, the consistency and speed of Home Depot's growth in revenue and earnings is hard to ignore.|No comp-arisonWhile analysts' projections are not always correct, it's easier to compare Home Depot's comparable-store-sales growth to its peers. While Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer, the company's expansion into grocery sales and sheer size have caused its comparable-store sales to slow.|In the most recent quarter, Wal-Mart reported same-store sales decreased domestically by 0.3%. Of course, Wal-Mart's greater size and lower exposure to faster-growing segments like home improvement and clothing have hurt the company's results. Where Lowe's and Home Depot are concerned, both benefited from an improvement in the housing industry; Lowe's performed well with a 6.2% increase in comps, but Home Depot did even better with a 7.4% increase.|By this measure, Wal-Mart generated $0.03 of core free cash flow per dollar of sales. While Lowe's doubled this production with $0.06 of core free cash flow, Home Depot did even better with $0.08 of cash flow per dollar of sales. With Home Depot generating 33% more relative free cash flow than Lowe's and 166% more free cash flow than Wal-Mart, to say that Home Depot is giving investors more bang for the buck is an understatement.

Among those most likely to see the exit door in my view are DuPont (NYSE: DD) , American Express (NYSE: AXP) , and Merck (NYSE: MRK) , assuming the right combination of events plays out.|For years, American Express made sense as a Dow component because of its then-unique exposure to the credit card industry. Other Dow components issued credit cards, but none had its own card network that worked with merchants to facilitate electronic transactions. Yet that all changed when Visa (NYSE: V) entered the Dow, in a move that brought the industry's behemoth into the average. Although American Express does have a travel business that gives it some distinctive characteristics compared to other financial stocks, its primary card segment is covered by Visa and JPMorgan Chase, whose Chase division is among the biggest issuers of credit cards in the world.|Dan Caplinger has made a cogent case for DuPont to exit the Dow. This much shrunken and continually shrinking conglomerate which has suffered from a severe case of corporate identity confusion for more than a decade no longer really represents the vigour and growth of the American economy. Sans chemicals, DuPont is really a second-place player in seeds to Monsanto, in crop protection to Syngenta and Bayer, and in enzymes and food additives to Novozymes.

For three days, the Seattle plane-maker's minions sat down with representatives of the International Association of Machinists, trying to hammer out an agreement. Success would guarantee Boeing a decade of smooth labor relations with its biggest labor union and reassure IAM members that they, rather than non-union workers in South Carolina or elsewhere, will have jobs building Boeing's new 777X long-haul airliner in Seattle for decades to come.|How it went downBeginning with afternoon talks Tuesday, Boeing and IAM representatives met to talk over their differences and begin drawing up proposals. By Wednesday, IAM had its plan worked out and offered Boeing a deal to replace the one presented by Boeing -- and rejected by a 2-to-1 margin in a union vote -- in November.|As you may recall, the major elements of Boeing's offer had been:|Job security for 32,000 Boeing machinists through 2024.|Immediate $10,000 signing bonuses for all of Boeing's IAM members.|IAM said these terms were "not close" to what it could accept and drew up a counterproposal ... which Boeing in its turn rejected. This set the stage for Thursday's "best and final" offer from Boeing:|Where we're at todaySo this is where we stand, again at an impasse. But this time, the negotiations between Boeing and IAM don't look at all like what we saw back in 2008, the last time these parties came to loggerheads.|Back then, tense and angry negotiations had IAM President Tom Buffenbarger threatening to call a strike, in hopes of draining Boeing's coffers at the rate of "$100 million a day," and bringing Boeing to its knees. (He followed through, too. In 2008-2009, a 57-day strike cost Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.)|Today, striking isn't an option. Because Boeing cleverly began negotiations more than two years before the current contract expires, the company sees little downside to requesting major concessions. Boeing can offer decades of 777X job security in exchange. On the other hand, if the union doesn't play ball, well ... Boeing has 22 other states knocking at its door, all offering to give the company tax breaks and eager workers, if IAM doesn't want the work. Indeed, just last week, Boeing announced that it has leased extra plant space in South Carolina. Technically, it says it will paint 787 Dreamliners there -- but I think the subtext to that announcement was pretty clear, given its timing.|Time to wrap this upSo how does this all shake out? Given that Boeing has little reason to offer immediate concessions, while IAM has much to lose if it does not accede to Boeing's demands, my guess is that in the end, IAM loses this fight. It'll be forced to give up its pension plan. It must grudgingly accept a switchover to 401(k)s.|And that's not a bad thing. From the perspective of Boeing and its shareholders, a removal of the constant uncertainty as to how future pension obligations affect earnings will be a welcome relief.|Meanwhile, once IAM negotiators admit that corporate pension plans are going the way of the dinosaur, they can focus on extracting from Boeing the very best 401(k) plans possible. Already, Boeing has offered to fund 401(k)s with 10% of gross salary in the first two years of the new contract. Rather than fight a battle they're certain to lose, IAM should focus on retaining those above-market 401(k) contributions for as long as possible.

After subtracting out cancellations, Boeing booked orders for a net 1,203 airplanes of various shapes and sizes in 2012. That was 370 planes more than Airbus sold -- a margin of victory 44 percentage points wide.|That Boeing and Airbus should switch positions from winner to loser, and vice versa, so quickly is nothing short of astounding. And yet, if you dig deeper into the numbers, you can see how it happened.|Historically, Boeing's biggest moneymaker has been its 737 single-aisle regional jet -- its self-proclaimed "best-selling commercial aircraft in aviation history." With more than 11,500 orders placed since inception, and a backlog of 3,400 orders yet to be filled, this franchise looked unassailable. But in 2013, as Boeing focused on making up lost time from production delays at its 787 widebody program, Airbus found an opening to make inroads in the regional jet market.|What we've done here is set orders for Boeing 747 jets and Airbus 380s to the side, and just focused on the two businesses in their roughly comparable "halves" -- single aisles and wide-bodies. This makes it a bit easier to see what happened this year.|In a nutshell: Boeing and Airbus ran a dead heat on wide-bodies, but Airbus ran away with the race in single aisles. Across the two plane makers' combined fleets, Airbus sold 22.5% more planes than Boeing; but in single aisles, that margin of victory widened past 31%, with Airbus selling 248 more A319s, A320s, and A321s than Boeing sold 737s.|Foolish takeaway And the good news for Boeing shareholders? In order for Boeing to recapture the sales lead from Airbus in 2014, all it really needs to do is sell more units of its already best-selling, lowest-price, most-profitable airplane.

China has the world's largest population and, according to many economists, will have the world's largest economy within a decade.|Since electricity usage generally correlates with GDP growth, China's energy demand is projected to increase significantly. As much as Chevron needs China, China also needs Chevron. Here are four reasons why.|Unlike Chevron and other oil super-majors, Chinese companies do not currently have the necessary knowledge, equipment, or experience to perform the deep horizontal drilling and fracking needed to extract these resources.|The quest for Western drilling technology to unlock those sizable natural gas reserves was the principle reason CNOOC (NYSE: CEO) bought Canadian oil and gas company Nexen (NYSE: NXY) and is also the main reason China needs to involve Chevron.|By allowing oil companies like Chevron to produce cleaner natural gas domestically, China can burn less dirty coal and reduce its pollution.|The bottom lineAt the end of the day, China needs Chevron as much as Chevron needs China. Developing oil and gas is not a zero-sum game; both China and Chevron can win.

The energy outlook heading into next year is one of mostly cautious optimism. The global economy remains on a path of steady, if unspectacular, recovery from the worst recession in decades. At the same time, domestic fiscal uncertainty and international geopolitical risk give energy majors like Chevron pause about how much to invest in 2014.|Capital expenditures are a primary focus when considering investment in one of the global energy majors. This is why Chevron's budget announcement contains some critical nuggets of information that investors need to be aware of.|Upstream gets the lion's shareChevron's 2014 capital budget will total $39.8 billion, down from the $42 billion spent this year. In the company's words, 2013 will represent a "peak" year for investment. Chevron allocated a great deal of resources this year into aggressive land acquisitions, which are not expected to continue next year. Furthermore, Chevron was under considerable pressure from analysts and investors who believed its spending got a little out of hand this year.|Interestingly, a full 90% of Chevron's 2014 spending will be on upstream operations. It's not entirely a surprise that downstream operations would be somewhat left in the cold, since refining has been such a huge drag this year. Refining woes have crippled profits for the integrated majors including Chevron and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , as the spread between U.S. crude oil and the Brent international benchmark narrowed. It should also be noted that the upstream is typically more capital intensive than downstream operations.|This has resulted in a severe profit decline for Exxon, and a more manageable earnings dip for Chevron. ExxonMobil has posted a 31% drop in net earnings in the first nine months of the year. For its part, Chevron saw a more modest 13% drop in net earnings through the first three quarters of the year.|Still, judging by Chevron's dwindled investment plans for downstream activities, it's apparent that the company has little confidence that refining trends will reverse in the near term. This could mean that the integrated majors that have significant downstream operations, such as ExxonMobil, will continue to suffer.|Chevron shuns the U.S.Another startling find from Chevron's 2014 budget is that the company will allocate the vast majority of its spending on international projects. Upstream and downstream spending on international plays will account for nearly three-quarters of next year's budget. This is a surprise because many oil and gas majors, such as ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) , are divesting international assets due to their pronounced geopolitical risks.|Going forward, ConocoPhillips is taking a vastly different approach than Chevron. In ConocoPhillips' own 2014 capital budget, it plans to allocate 55% of its $16.7 billion in planned spending to North American projects.|Clearly Chevron isn't worried about investing in riskier parts of the world, and proved as much in its 2014 capital budget. However, investors should keep this in mind in subsequent quarters, as the level of geopolitical risk largely hasn't changed, nor is it likely to change any time soon.|The Foolish bottom lineChevron's 2014 capital expenditure budget contains several key nuggets of information that investors would be wise to note. It's planning to reduce spending from last year, which reflects a level of broad macroeconomic uncertainty. In addition, Chevron will be devoting the vast majority of its efforts to upstream activities and toward international projects. These are truly surprising developments, given the boom in oil and gas production in the United States and the relative instability of riskier international geographies.|As a result, investors should carefully consider whether they agree with Chevron's strategies before buying the stock.

Already, the company has taken great strides toward narrowing its focus on high-margin agricultural products, with its acquisition of Pannar Seed in South Africa opening up a lucrative new market for the company. DuPont has also made plans to spin off its performance chemicals business, with the company giving itself a roughly 18-month timeframe to make the move. Moreover, with cross-licensing agreements with most of its major rivals, DuPont looks well-positioned to take its share of the growing worldwide market for yield-enhancing crop traits that can help farmers respond better to changing weather and growing conditions. The question for DuPont's continued Dow viability is whether it makes enough additional acquisition to boost its ag business to keep up its overall revenue and justify its continued membership among the Dow 30.|Dan Caplinger has made a cogent case for DuPont to exit the Dow. This much shrunken and continually shrinking conglomerate which has suffered from a severe case of corporate identity confusion for more than a decade no longer really represents the vigour and growth of the American economy.

For three days, the Seattle plane-maker's minions sat down with representatives of the International Association of Machinists, trying to hammer out an agreement. Success would guarantee Boeing a decade of smooth labor relations with its biggest labor union and reassure IAM members that they, rather than non-union workers in South Carolina or elsewhere, will have jobs building Boeing's new 777X long-haul airliner in Seattle for decades to come.|How it went downBeginning with afternoon talks Tuesday, Boeing and IAM representatives met to talk over their differences and begin drawing up proposals. By Wednesday, IAM had its plan worked out and offered Boeing a deal to replace the one presented by Boeing -- and rejected by a 2-to-1 margin in a union vote -- in November.|As you may recall, the major elements of Boeing's offer had been:|Job security for 32,000 Boeing machinists through 2024.|Immediate $10,000 signing bonuses for all of Boeing's IAM members.|IAM said these terms were "not close" to what it could accept and drew up a counterproposal ... which Boeing in its turn rejected. This set the stage for Thursday's "best and final" offer from Boeing:|Where we're at todaySo this is where we stand, again at an impasse. But this time, the negotiations between Boeing and IAM don't look at all like what we saw back in 2008, the last time these parties came to loggerheads.|Back then, tense and angry negotiations had IAM President Tom Buffenbarger threatening to call a strike, in hopes of draining Boeing's coffers at the rate of "$100 million a day," and bringing Boeing to its knees. (He followed through, too. In 2008-2009, a 57-day strike cost Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.)|Today, striking isn't an option. Because Boeing cleverly began negotiations more than two years before the current contract expires, the company sees little downside to requesting major concessions. Boeing can offer decades of 777X job security in exchange. On the other hand, if the union doesn't play ball, well ... Boeing has 22 other states knocking at its door, all offering to give the company tax breaks and eager workers, if IAM doesn't want the work. Indeed, just last week, Boeing announced that it has leased extra plant space in South Carolina. Technically, it says it will paint 787 Dreamliners there -- but I think the subtext to that announcement was pretty clear, given its timing.|Time to wrap this upSo how does this all shake out? Given that Boeing has little reason to offer immediate concessions, while IAM has much to lose if it does not accede to Boeing's demands, my guess is that in the end, IAM loses this fight. It'll be forced to give up its pension plan. It must grudgingly accept a switchover to 401(k)s.|And that's not a bad thing. From the perspective of Boeing and its shareholders, a removal of the constant uncertainty as to how future pension obligations affect earnings will be a welcome relief.|Meanwhile, once IAM negotiators admit that corporate pension plans are going the way of the dinosaur, they can focus on extracting from Boeing the very best 401(k) plans possible. Already, Boeing has offered to fund 401(k)s with 10% of gross salary in the first two years of the new contract. Rather than fight a battle they're certain to lose, IAM should focus on retaining those above-market 401(k) contributions for as long as possible.

So it's only reasonable for you to get a little defensive with your portfolio. That's where health care heavy-weights GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson stand out.

Pfizer may very well hit a home run (or several) with the billions it's spending to try to replace lost Lipitor sales, but that is far from a guarantee. As a result, you may want to assume a defensive position heading into 2014, and give GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson a closer look among large-cap health care stocks.

That makes this an easy win for Nike , which has made regular payments to shareholders for more than 25 years since it first initiated dividends in 1987.|Winner: Nike, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Starbucks has increased its dividend payouts at least once every year since it began paying dividends in 2010. However, Nike has been raising its dividend at least once per year since 2003, according to Dividata. A solid decade of dividend-raising lets Nike win the stability crown without any hassles.|Winner: Nike, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Nike may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Nike has a better shot at long-term outperformance, thanks to its commitment to innovative products, its ubiquitous brand recognition, and its unrivalled merchandising strategies. The company's Fuelband line also offers the chance to build a new moat among tech-savvy fitness fans, although this is sure to be a highly competitive arena. Starbucks, on the other hand, could benefit greatly from an expanded presence in the emerging markets, but it may face fierce competition from other specialty coffee outlets.

It's been a fantastic year for many health care stocks, including GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) , Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) , which have all performed extremely well.|Of course, the question is whether this positive momentum can continue into next year. The broader market has registered impressive gains, meaning it may be a good time for you to curb your enthusiasm for 2014. That's why, in light of GlaxoSmithKline's and J&J's diversified business models, you may want to favor those two, and by the same token, take a cautious approach to Pfizer.|Why Pfizer is a riskier betPfizer has taken a number of strategic initiatives in recent years to streamline its business. These may very well pay off, assuming Pfizer will execute on its priorities. At the same time, the fact that Pfizer's business is less integrated than its peers exposes investors to a particular set of concerns.|First and foremost is that Pfizer is now virtually a pharmaceutical pure play after spinning off its animal health care business earlier this year. Pfizer does have a consumer products business, but that segment contributes only about 6% to its overall revenue.|Furthermore, investors should be concerned about Pfizer's pipeline, as it is still struggling in the aftermath of Lipitor losing its patent exclusivity. Lipitor was the best-selling drug ever and provided nearly $10 billion in annual sales, as recently as 2011. To date, Lipitor has generated just $1.7 billion in sales, down by nearly half from the same period last year.|Overall, Pfizer saw sales fall 7% through the first nine months of the year. Earnings are up, but much of that has to do with lower expenses and a one-time gain related to discontinued operations. From a core business perspective, there are many lingering questions that Pfizer needs to address.|The Foolish takeawayWhile GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson may seem like lumbering giants, their diversified operations and steady consumer products businesses provide valuable stability. Pfizer may very well hit a home run (or several) with the billions it's spending to try to replace lost Lipitor sales, but that is far from a guarantee. As a result, you may want to assume a defensive position heading into 2014, and give GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson a closer look among large-cap health care stocks.

Coca-Cola's and PepsiCo's revenues exceed Dr Pepper's revenue by eight and 10 times, respectively. Coca-Cola's cash stash exceeds both companies by a wide margin and the company possesses the least amount of debt as a percentage of equity. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and their bottling and distribution partners also maintain ever-increasing global presence, expanding into areas such as Eastern Europe, India, China, and the Philippines. In addition, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo maintain a presence in two of the world's largest restaurant chains -- McDonald's and Yum! Brands -- via fountain dispensers. Dr Pepper Snapple Group by contrast operates mainly in the Western Hemisphere and usually only warrants one or two spots in a soda fountain usually hosted by PepsiCo or Coca-Cola.|DiversityPepsiCo and Coca-Cola also sport the most diversity in their respective product portfolios. Note from the table above that PepsiCo sports the highest amount of revenue, most likely due to the fact that PepsiCo also sells snacks and food in addition to beverages. PepsiCo owns the Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats brands, which serve as a buffer against declining carbonated soda demand. Still beverages also make up 11 of Coca-Cola's 16 most significant brands. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group does sell the Mott's brand, which represents a healthy beverage and snack brand. However, Dr Pepper Snapple Group is making efforts to expand its healthier offerings, such as the partnership with Sunny Delight Beverages to sell Sparkling Fruit2O and Bai Brands fruit based infusion drinks.|DividendsActually, on the dividend front Dr Pepper Snapple Group is the winner, with a 3.1% dividend yield. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo each yield 2.8% as of this writing. However, Coca-Cola's dividend payment resides in the safest position, with $17 billion in cash and short-term investments. Coca-Cola's dividend-to-free cash flow ratio resides at the lowest level, paying out 41% so far in 2013. PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple Group paid out 49% and 44%, respectively, of their year-to-date free cash flow.|Foolish takeawayCoca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper Snapple each face headwinds from the healthy-lifestyles movement. Increased consumer awareness about the health effects of carbonated sodas in addition to increased scrutiny and regulations from governments around the globe will force each of these companies to rethink their strategies and product portfolios. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, with their relative balance-sheet strengths in terms of cash and debt, are in the best position to do that, making them a better investment than Dr Pepper Snapple Group.|Fool contributor William Bias owns shares of Coca-Cola and McDonald's.

SodaStream, with about six times the growth, is comparable. Many investors have put money in this industry because they deem it safe, investing in companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) . However, you can buy SodaStream much cheaper than Coca-Cola, and with much more chance of growth.|In 2013, Coca-Cola is expected to see a year-over-year revenue decline of 1.6; the company has suffered due to new health initiatives and a focus on the risks of sugar intake. Moreover, in the company's last quarter it saw total sales decline 2.5%, and this occurred despite a 2% rise in case volume, driven in part by emerging markets. This offset in case volume growth and revenue declines shows that Coca-Cola is under pricing pressure.|With SodaStream, its products are relatively healthy; its growth is substantial, and is showing no signs of slowing. Not to mention, SodaStream can be purchased much cheaper than Coca-Cola.|Foolish outlookCoca-Cola trades at 3.7 times sales and a forward P/E ratio of 17.7, both of which are higher than the S&P 500 index average. Thus it is very difficult to find a reason that SodaStream has fallen below $50 and remains such a heavily shorted stock.

(V: Quote) revealed in a regulatory filing on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf received a 2013 total compensation of $24.20 million.|Scharf, age 48, took over as the company's CEO in November 2012, succeeded Joseph Saunders. He was als0 appointed as a board member after increasing the size of the board to eleven members from ten. He has more than 25 years of financial services, payments systems and leadership experience. He was also a director of Visa and its predecessor, Visa U.S.A., from 2003 to 2011.|Scharf has also received a one-time make-whole equity award structured in value, form and timing to replicate compensation that he forfeited by leaving his former employer to join Visa. The one-time award totaled $19.0 million, including $13.0 million as stock grants, and $6.0 million as stock options.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/15/why-a-recent-surge-in-retail-sales-could-hurt-thes.aspx|12/15/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|0|More sales vs. profitable salesDiscount retailers including Target (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) were big winners during Black Friday weekend. This year, more than 5 million customers participated in Wal-Mart's One-Hour Guarantee promotion, while more than 22 million people shopped at its stores on Thanksgiving night. Target also had a record showing. The bull's-eye chain said both sales and traffic on its website on Thanksgiving were among the highest Target has ever seen in a single day.|Yet while both Wal-Mart and Target achieved record sales over Black Friday weekend, those sales also bear the burden of thinner profit margins. Price pressure on retailers this year is hurting many companies' bottom line. Margins at retailers including Target and department store chain Macy's have fallen to 5.2% down from 6% as a result, according to data from Thomas Reuters.|One of the problems is that stores are trying to one-up each other on price this holiday season. Target and Wal-Mart, for example, have been locked in a pricing battle on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products they sell. Wal-Mart was the first big-box to slash the price of Apple's new iPhone 5c earlier this year. However, Target quickly followed suit, offering the 16GB version for $79.99 with a two-year service contract, down from Apple's retail price of $99.|For Black Friday, Target gave away $100 gift cards with every iPad purchase. Additionally, throughout the holidays Target is selling Apple's latest version of the device, the iPad Air, for $479. That's a $20 savings over Apple's price for the product. Still, the real winner here is Apple. In fact, Apple's 16GB iPad Air was the top-selling device at Wal-Mart and Target stores on Black Friday, according to InfoScout.|A challenging retail environmentFor Target and Wal-Mart, this highly promotional holiday season is eroding profits. While it's true that more people shopped this year during Black Friday weekend, customers actually spent less compared to last year, according to early reports from the National Retail Federation. Wal-Mart said same-store sales growth for the holiday quarter would be "relatively flat." Nevertheless, Wal-Mart continued its sharp discounting on Dec. 13, with the retailer dropping prices on popular toys, electronics, and apparel as part of its "Christmas countdown savings event."
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/14/apple-will-be-crushed-if-smartphone-subsidies-go-a.aspx|12/14/2013|0|"AT&T"|1|Smartphone subsidies could be coming to an end. While prepaid providers have long refused to pay for their subscribers' phones, the practice has begun to spread to the major carriers, with T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) abandoning subsidies and AT&T (NYSE: T) hinting that it will do the same.|Historically, about 80% of AT&T's smartphone sales are Apple-made handsets, though this could change in the wake of the company's new policy. The recently launched "Mobile Share Value Plan" allows AT&T subscribers to reduce their monthly bill if they use a paid-for handset.|For now, AT&T still offers subsidies, but that could change. The company's CEO said earlier this week that the subsidy model cannot continue -- carriers cannot afford to keep paying for their subscribers' handsets.|Apple could well afford to subsidize their own iPhones. Just because AT&T doesn't want to do subsidies anymore that doesn't mean every other carrier will follow suit. All that could happen to AT&T is that they would lose customers as consumers started to switch to other carriers who do have subsidies if it's possible for them to do so. Also, Apple could simply let people pay for their iPhones over a period of time just like they do on the online Apple store. Apple should become a loan company with as much reserve cash as they have.|The real reason why 'premium' phones still cost $600+ (like they did back in 2007) and not $350+ (as a result of the massive fall in component costs that have been occurring yearly since 2007) is because of the US subsidy system itself. Every high end phone including Apple's $850 64GB iPhone are all made from around $200 in parts. These phones, high end or low end, are not expensive to make; the high prices are completely artificial and have nothing to do with quality. Take a look at the manufacturing cost of the iPhone vs the iPad. The iPhone and iPad are actually made using most of the very same components and circuitry. The iPad costs substantially more to make than the iPhone because it uses a much larger, and therefore more costly display and battery. But look at the final price. The full size iPad costs $150 less than the tiny iPhone with the same memory size despite costing more to make. The only reason the iPhone costs more is because Apple is simply pricing the iPhone to abuse the subsidy system...and Samsung has followed in their footsteps with their high end phones. What consumers don't grasp yet is that all abuses of the subsidy system eventually come out of their own pockets because carriers passing those costs down as hidden fees rather than absorb them. America ends up with ridiculously high data costs while in other markets that don't subsidize phones, data costs are already falling as carriers are financially free to actually compete on data price. In order to do the same in the US, carriers are going to have to do what T-Mobile and now AT&T are doing - create mobile plans that separate phone costs from data costs so that consumers can pick phones that they can actually afford rather than pick phones that are artificially made affordable.|So, there you have it. Subsidies, the very thing that was meant to make acquiring smartphone hardware more affordable, is now the thing that is keeping the price paid for high end hardware ultra expensive despite the progressive fall in component prices. And it's also the very thing keeping the cost of monthly data far higher than it should be. Carriers are now increasingly sensitive to this reality, because the remaining US mobile users who have not yet switched away from feature phones are the very folks who are extremely price sensitive when it comes to both phone costs and monthly fees. That's why T-Mobile started gaining more monthly subscribers than AT&T and taking AT&T customers, and that's why AT&T, the big iPhone seller, had no choice but to respond.|There is a key difference in how people see it. People associate the $20 on service with service even though it's actually for the phone. Second, it's more than $20. AT&T/Verizon and Sprint are charging way more than $20 on device fee. Verizon is more like $40. Meaning that iPhone is closer to $1,000 after two years. How many people are going to pay that much?|When you break out your device fee, you can compare that to compeitors as well as service fee and make an informed decision. T-Mobile has given the market a huge dosage of transparency and that is a big problem for Verizon and AT&T.|iPhones account for something like 80% of AT&T's phones, but account for about 20% of T-Mobile phones sold. Moving more towards T-Mobile's financing where the carrier flat up tells you how much you're going to pay is going to cause iPhones (and $649 Samsungs) to see their sales plummet. Most people don't realize what their phone is actually costing them. Many ignorant consumers think that down payment is everything. Strip that illusion from them and they're going to change their behaviors like consumers who live in countries where subsidization isn't happening. Spain doesn't subside and iPhone market share is under 5% there. Yes, 5%.|Mattera, it's not a subsidy but a financing scheme for the AT&T's to get subscribers. The subscriber STILL pays for the iPhone but in monthly payments. The same is true with Verizon and probably T Mobile. And the "subsidy" is also used to sell Android devices. But they're NOT subsidies even if you media geniuses continue to call them that.

The issue: Who's the bigger airplane builder?|Boeing wins!With $85.1 billion in trailing revenues to Airbus's $81.2 billion, Boeing, of course, is the bigger airplane builder. Boeing has a bigger commercial plane business, too, with $49.1 billion in revenues in its last fiscal year versus $48.7 billion at Airbus. For that matter, the $2.8 billion that Airbus Military collected last year -- even if paired with the $8.2 billion at Eurocopter -- still isn't a patch on the $16.4 billion raked in at Boeing's Military Aircraft division.|Profits-wise, too, Boeing is clearly the leader. Trailing 12-month operating profits margins are 7.6% at Boeing -- superior to the 4.4% operating margin at Airbus. As a result, over the past 12 months, Boeing has earned $4.3 billion from its aerospace business. And EADS?|Or does it?It's also where, finally, Airbus aficionados have their day. Because, as of this week, and based on Boeing's most up-to-date tally of airplanes sold, it looks like Airbus is about to claim the 2013 crown as "world's best airplane salesman." Here's how the race stands as the clock ticks down to the final days of 2013:|Boeing|Source: Boeing, Airbus|With just two weeks left in the airplane-selling season, Airbus leads Boeing on all counts:|Can Boeing catch up by year end? I honestly doubt it. The company did just record 61 new orders for its 737 MAX jetliner from Air Canada this week. Management seemed to think it would be able to get those planes into the order book pretty quickly -- but didn't quite make the cut in time for Thursday's order-book update.|Boeing also landed 259 "orders and commitments" (to order) its new 777X airliner at last month's Dubai Airshow. Combined, the MAXes and the 777Xes could conceivably add up to enough new business to put Boeing back in the lead by year end. However, few, if any, of the 777X orders have found their way onto Boeing's books as actual firm orders since being announced nearly a month ago.|Conclusion: In this one respect, at least, it looks like the race is Airbus's to lose. Barring a last minute surge, Airbus will reclaim from Boeing the crown it lost in 2012.|Heads, you win. Tails, you don't loseSo Boeing sold the most planes last year? And Airbus sold more planes this year? Well, as long as they take turns like that, both companies should serve their shareholders admirably... forever!

The Army is currently developing an "Armed Aerial Scout," also known as an "Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter", or ARH, to replace the Kiowa. Most major defense contractors are bidding on the work -- Textron (NYSE: TXT) , which builds the Kiowa, and also Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) , Boeing (NYSE: BA) , United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) , AgustaWestland, and even Airbus parent EADS.|But there's no guarantee ARH will ever get built. A previous attempt by Boeing and UTC's Sikorsky unit to build a replacement scout, the "Comanche," was canceled over cost-overruns in 2004... after burning through $7 billion in taxpayer dollars. The current ARH effort, meanwhile, is at risk of cancellation due to the same budget cuts that now have the Army talking about killing the Kiowa!|But if the Kiowa does get dumped, that's probably bad news for Textron, which will lose a big part of its services business. It will be better news for Boeing and United Technologies, who will see their Apaches and Black Hawks (respectively) get more flight time, and consequently require more maintenance work and spare parts.|The lakota was never meant to be a Kiowa replacement-the Boeing Little Bird is actually the best bet(and a better aircraft)-it's quick, reliable, and is still in service with SOAR. Oh, and every pilot whose flown one, prefers it as a scout.

In addition, falling natural-gas prices have affected ExxonMobil and Chevron's earnings for most of the year, since both companies have made natural-gas production a key strategic priority.|Recently, though, the decline in natural-gas prices has reversed. Due to severe weather conditions across the United States, natural gas recently hit $4.34, representing a six-month high. The abrupt rally in natural gas may now serve to boost earnings for ExxonMobil and Chevron in future periods, which couldn't come at a more opportune time. This is why investors should consider natural gas a potential tailwind heading into 2014.|Chevron is also committed to natural-gas development, since the company points out to investors that natural gas now comprises 22% of global energy demand. Chevron estimates that as global populations expand, under-developed economies emerge, and the world's thirst for energy grows, natural gas will play an increasing role in the global energy mix.|Chevron produced approximately 5.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2012 and will increase production exponentially over the next decade. Specifically, the company points investors to its major projects in Australia and Africa, including the Gorgon Project, which includes a 15 million metric-ton-per-year liquefied- natural-gas facility.|The Foolish takeawayAside from their obviously significant oil operations, ExxonMobil and Chevron are making huge investments in natural gas. For most of this year, those efforts haven't paid off, as natural-gas prices languished. Now, that trend is reversing, and natural gas is shaping up to be a strong tailwind for ExxonMobil and Chevron heading into 2014.|It might be difficult to perceive the benefits of natural gas right now, since the headline numbers out of ExxonMobil and Chevron look pretty scary. Indeed, ExxonMobil has posted a 31% drop in net earnings in the first nine months of the year. For its part, Chevron saw a more modest 13% drop in net earnings through the first three quarters of the year.|But as mentioned previously, this is almost entirely due to worsening refining operations. All the while, the fundamentals of natural gas look strong as the new year beckons. Investors interested in the natural-gas industry would be wise not to forget about ExxonMobil and Chevron. Their profits aren't reflecting the benefits of natural-gas production yet, as refining continues to get most of the attention. However, thanks to the rally in natural-gas prices, investors should begin to see tangible benefits from natural gas soon.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/14/is-huntsman-destined-for-greatness.aspx|12/14/2013|0|"DuPont"|0|Huntsman's latest quarterly results showed lackluster figures due to the substantial costs associated with its pigments division, as well as persistent international weakness, especially in Europe. However, the company has been able to partially offset the losses incurred in its pigments division through sulfate ore, which is currently being used to produce 60% of Huntsman's titanium dioxide (TiO2). DuPont (NYSE: DD) has been similarly battered of late due to high titanium ore costs, which produced a wretched 39% slide in its performance chemicals division's operating profit. Fool contributor Neha Chamaria notes that the global TiO2 market has suffered from excessive inventory levels, which has dragged pigment prices to multiyear lows. Huntsman and fellow chemical giant Dow Chemical's (NYSE: DOW) polyurethanes divisions were also plagued by high feedstock costs during the third quarter.|Fool analyst Taylor Muckerman points out that Huntsman and its peers have been streamlining their businesses to move away from the uncertainties of chemical demand. Huntsman and DuPont both plan to spin off their TiO2 business, which will allow them to concentrate on high profitable businesses -- assuming enough demand exists to absorb two major TiO2 manufacturers at the same time. The two companies could wind up hurting each other in an effort to get rid of these poor performers. Dow also divested its non-performing businesses to focus on Agricultural Sciences, which has delivered huge growth over the past few quarters. These three chemical companies are having trouble finding adequately skilled workers for their chemical divisions, which also doesn't help balance issues of demand and profitability.|Despite weakness in its own TiO2 segment and apparent plans for a spinoff, Huntsman's going ahead with a planned acquisition of Rockwood Holdings' titanium dioxide and performance additives segments for $1.33 billion in cash and debt. Neha Chamaria points out that the transaction will make Huntsman the world's second-biggest TiO2 producer after DuPont, but it may not have made the best decision for several reasons. According to Bloomberg, Huntsman might also team up with Tronox to expand its TiO2 business, which could pose potential threats to DuPont's business, provided profit margins improve. This strategy of wading further into the TiO2 market while simultaneously appearing to distance itself from it does not indicate a coherent strategy from Huntsman's top brass, and could be a signal to investors that the company doesn't have a strong plan for the future.

ExxonMobil's followed other international energy giants into the region, and its entrance into Liberia's energy market -- along with that of PetroChina and other top global players -- should only help this rebuilding economy take its early steps in rebuilding from years of conflict.|Unlike Liberia, the situation here isn't likely to get much better fast -- for either Eritreans or global companies with African ambitions, such as aforementioned ExxonMobil and PetroChina. With Eritrea's oil and energy situation a virtual unknown and little in the way of economic or political stability, this is a country stuck in a rut. The IMF estimates that Eritrea's per-capita GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity will grow only around 1.7% between 2013 and 2018, a mark that will lead to the nation being ranked as the second-poorest country in the world by that time.|However, resource companies in both the materials and energy sectors have wizened up to Africa's potential over the past decades. Companies such as Freeport and Exxon-Mobil, among others, face great potential if they can take advantage of Africa's mineral and resource wealth, and China's made a strong push into Africa in its own bid to secure natural resource dominance.

Due to its $41 billion acquisition of XTO Energy in 2009, ExxonMobil is now a leading natural-gas producer. With XTO Energy now under its umbrella, ExxonMobil is the nation's largest holder of natural-gas reserves.|This hasn't worked in ExxonMobil's favor yet, since natural-gas prices have stayed low for most of the year. As a result, ExxonMobil's natural-gas production decreased through the first nine months of 2013 versus the same period last year. However, ExxonMobil is actually reporting higher natural-gas demand. This means that investors can expect ExxonMobil to be quickly incentivized to increase production given the rising price of natural gas.|ExxonMobil's efforts are concentrated in the Piceance Basin, which is a truly impressive region. ExxonMobil holds an interest in approximately 300,000 acres there, and the company's leases hold a potential recoverable resource of more than 45 trillion cubic feet of gas over the life of the project. As a result, it goes without saying that natural gas is incredibly important to ExxonMobil.|The Foolish takeawayAside from their obviously significant oil operations, ExxonMobil and Chevron are making huge investments in natural gas.

While all three further validated the continued strength of the home-improvement space, Restoration Hardware had, without question, the most impressive showing. Who had the best outlook now?|A megacap that keeps exceeding expectations: Home DepotHome Depot has seen an impressive five-year 235% appreciation in its company's valuation, driven by fundamental growth. During this period, it always appeared as though growth would reach a peak, but based on the company's outlook, this so-called peak is nowhere near.|Home Depot recently issued a business update, and is now guiding for 2014 sales growth of 5% year over year. In addition, it expects the operating margin to expand 70 basis points and eventually rise to 17% by 2015; the operating margin is currently 11.5%.|Therefore, Home Depot expects earnings-per-share growth of 17% next year, which is quite an accomplishment for a large and established retailer.|Which is best?In reality, to compare these three companies and to then determine the best investment opportunity is not fair. Home Depot is on another level, where expansion is no longer relevant and the stock is driven more-so by mid-single-digit growth and margin expansion. However, at this point, given Home Depot's consistent growth, it'd definitely be hard to bet against the stock.|What makes Restoration so attractive?Honestly, we could look at 100 different things as it relates to Restoration versus Lumber Liquidators. We could point to the fact that Restoration has significantly faster growth yet Restoration trades at just 1.3 times its 2014 expected sales; Lumber Liquidators trades at 2.1 times its 2014 guided sales. In fact, if we use 2014 estimates as a guide, Restoration trades at the same multiple as Home Depot, yet Restoration is growing about five times faster. Thus Restoration deserves a higher premium.|Thus, both Home Depot and Lumber Liquidators gave great updates, but regardless of Restoration's stock performance, it had the best showing and is surprisingly the cheapest stock. As an investor, don't expect its post-earnings double-digit losses to last long.

Home prices have been dribbling along for years, but finally seemed to have picked up over the last 12 to 18 months. That's given Americans new reasons to fix up their old houses, and put existing homes in the hands of new owners, eager to turn them into dream homes. There's arguably no better place to supply that dream than at Home Depot (NYSE: HD) .|The stock started to see some love this year, as well, beating out the S&P 500 as sales rose at the retailer. Home Depot is finishing off the year strong, raising its yearly guidance as customers rush back into the store. That demand push has driven a solid increase in comparable store sales, and the company now expects the year to end with a 7% year-over-year increase.|That puts Home Depot in the driver's seat headed into 2014, and it has a route all planned out. The company is going to use its momentum to fuel a $5 billion stock repurchase, expand its operating margin, and increase earnings per share by more than 15%.|A projected 5% increase in revenue is the engine sitting under Home Depot's hood. As the housing market continues to grow in 2014, Home Depot should be well poised to reap the benefits. According to one recent study, the percentage of Americans planning to make a house purchase in the next six months is the highest it's been in over a decade. That's good news for Home Depot and its investors.|The bottom lineAs we box up the remnants of 2013, investors have a lot to look forward to. Next year may be good or bad, but these three companies have set themselves up for success in all kinds of weather. From the solid, steady return of Costco to the housing market champion Home Depot to the game-changing Amazon, these companies are doing retail right.|Fool contributor Andrew Marder has no position in any stocks mentioned.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/14/why-the-bernie-madoff-case-is-so-dangerous-for-jpm.aspx|12/14/2013|0|"JP Morgan"|0|Why the Bernie Madoff Case Is So Dangerous for JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is on the verge of agreeing to a historic settlement with federal authorities over its relationship with Bernie Madoff. The bank may pay fines of up to $2 billion, while also agreeing to a deferred prosecution for violating the Bank Secrecy Act.|An earlier lawsuit against JPMorgan filed by Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee tasked with recovering Madoff's clients' funds, provides a good indication of the charges facing the company. Picard notes that JPMorgan Chase was Madoff's "primary banker for over 20 years, and was responsible for knowing the business of its customers -- in this case very large customers." Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that JPMorgan "had everything it needed to unmask and stop the fraud -- it had unique information from which it could have reached only one plausible conclusion: Madoff was a fraud."|We believe Picard's evidence reflects very poorly on JPMorgan. Not only did the bank's actions possibly violate the law, but its poor due diligence and willingness to profit off Madoff's dubious activities suggest that the company's culture is deeply flawed.|1. JPMorgan Chase ignored years of red flags in Madoff's Chase bank account that he used for money laundering and Ponzi scheme payouts.|Banks are required to know the purpose of customer accounts and monitor them for suspicious activities, but JPMorgan Chase never halted or reported the suspicious activity in Madoff's so-called "703 account."|In December 2001, the account received daily checks of $90 million from that same customer, who was also an important JPMorgan Chase client.|Even though JPMorgan's algorithms should have identified lots of suspicious activity, its computers almost never issued any alerts. After Madoff was arrested, JPMorgan Chase compliance employees thought the omission odd, asking "Why didn't the DDA Account (xxxxx1703) alert ... ?"|For more than 10 years, Madoff's Client Relationship Manager, Richard Cassa, was the 703 account's "account sponsor" -- the JPMorgan Chase employee responsible for monitoring Madoff's account and ensuring the bank understood Madoff's business. From the lawsuit, we learn that he essentially pleaded total incompetence:|Even after JPMorgan Chase reported Madoff's Ponzi scheme to British authorities so that the bank could retrieve its own money in October 2008 without alerting any American authorities, JPMorgan Chase allowed Madoff to continue operating his account without any restrictions on it. Madoff was eventually arrested in December 2008.|3. JPMorgan Chase knew at least as far back as 2006 that Bernie Madoff funds were suspicious.|Around 2006, JPMorgan Chase began considering selling its own financial products based on Madoff feeder funds. Before selling these products to investors, JPMorgan Chase had to check out Madoff and the funds that the bank wanted to base its own products on.|4. Despite its suspicions, JPMorgan Chase went ahead and sold to its customers financial products based on Bernie Madoff feeder funds.|Most of the funds JPMorgan Chase created and sold to investors used borrowed money to magnify the returns from Madoff funds. By March 2007, JPMorgan Chase had $100 million worth of Madoff products it was structuring in the pipeline and was thinking of creating an additional $100 million to $200 million.|The products were to be so profitable that at one point JPMorgan Chase employees calculated that "[b]ased on the overall estimated size of [our Bernie Madoff] strategy, it would take [a] ... fraud in the order of $3bn or more ... for JPMC to be affected."|James Coffman, a credit risk manager, told bankers they needed to do more due diligence on Madoff in order to go above a $100 million limit. So on March 30, Richard Cassa, who was responsible for monitoring Madoff's bank account, and members of the Risk Management Division spoke with Madoff. Even though the products JPMorgan wanted to create would have led to increased investments in Madoff's fund, Madoff told them he disliked banks structuring products on his strategy and was not willing to let JPMorgan Chase engage in "full due diligence."|Nevertheless, JPMorgan Chase's Equity Exotics team put together a "Transaction Approval Package." Noted transaction weaknesses included "investors, sub-Custodians, auditors etc rely solely on Madoff produced statements and have no real way of verifying positions at Madoff itself," and "[f]raud -- given the significant reliance on BLM for verification of assets held, and no real way to confirm those valuations, fraud presents a material risk."|5. JPMorgan Chase sold more Madoff-based products to customers after ignoring internal warnings that Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.|6. JPMorgan neglected to report Madoff to American law enforcement ... even after it told a British financial authority that the bank was retrieving its own Madoff investments because he was a fraud.|When JPMorgan tried to get its money back from one of Madoff's dodgy feeder funds, the fund threatened an investment banker that its "Colombian friends" would "cause havoc," telling him, "we know where to find you."|JPMorgan Chase complained to British authorities about the threats and explained that the bank wanted money back because it had long suspected Madoff's business wasn't legitimate:|Ultimately, the bank reached the same conclusion it had reached during its initial due diligence efforts in 2006 and 2007; JPMorgan was unable to obtain [look through] transparency at the Feeder Fund level, did not have access to the identities of the counterparties to Madoff's OTC options, did not fully understand the relationship between the broker-dealer and the investment advisor, and noted the fact that the custodians did not actually hold the assets.|In an October 2008 Suspicious Activity Report to the British authorities, JPMorgan wrote:|JPMCB's [JPMorgan Chase Bank] concerns around Madoff Securities are based (1) on the investment performance achieved by its funds which is so consistently and significantly ahead of its peers, year-on-year, even in the prevailing market conditions, as to appear too good to be true -- meaning that it probably is; and (2) the lack of transparency around Madoff Securities' trading techniques, the implementation of its investment strategy and the identity of its OTC option counterparties; and (3) its unwillingness to provide helpful information. As a result, JPMCB has sent out redemption notices in respect of one fund, and is preparing similar notices for two more funds.|While JPMorgan successfully redeemed all but $35 million of its own investment in Madoff, the bank didn't close down Madoff's JPMorgan Chase bank account that he used for laundering funds and operating his Ponzi scheme, nor did it report Madoff to American authorities or law enforcement.|Employees were urged to keep quiet about why they would no longer offer Madoff feeder funds to prospective investors: "Without disclosing too much, [JPMorgan Chase] got rid of all the Madoff feeder[s]."|7. Following Madoff's confession, the JPMorgan Chase employees responsible for due diligence weren't exactly surprised he had been a fraud.|Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer at JPMorgan Global Wealth Management, emailed Private Bank customers to inform them that the Private Bank had decided not to invest with Madoff because it had "never been able to reverse engineer how they [made] money" and Madoff's fund "did not satisfy [their] requirement for administrative oversight."|Is JPMorgan worthy of our trust? If Bernie Madoff has taught us anything, it's that trust is central to the relationship between investors and their financial institutions. Without trust, the whole system falls apart.|In recent months, JPMorgan has seen its trustworthiness called into question by a wide array of investigations and settlements. And the Madoff deal promises to be one of the most damaging of all to the company's reputation. JPMorgan's stakeholders should insist that restoring the bank's reputation becomes the primary goal of the firm in 2014 and beyond.|Wow, what a damning article. It would be nice to hear some follow-up from a knowledgeable lawyer who could comment on what constitutes criminal behavior by fiduciaries who don't do their due diligence. It seems like at the very least, JPMCB would become a party to the fraud the moment they allegedly know that he is running a Ponzi scheme and don't close down his account or alert American authorities. But I am no lawyer and wouldn't want to state this as a fact. I put it out there as a conjecture in need of illumination by someone with real professional knowledge of the law.|JP Morgan Chase is involved in just about every financial scam in history. They are going from one law suit to the next and at their own admission had to drastically increase their "Compliance Cost" also known as their Fraud Fund for next year due to all the pending litigation against this criminal outfit. How anyone can still trust this bank is beyond me.|This case analysis is proof the US needs to adopt the steps taken by Iceland to support their banking system. Individuals at JPMorganChase responsible for over-site of the Madoff accounts need to go to jail and the bank itself needs to be broken up. No bank should ever be considered "too big to fail." This will be the only way the American people will again have faith in the banking system.|I believe that if the government had the integrity they should have, many of the JP Morgan folks and other bankers as well, would go to jail. The bank should pay enormous fines, but more importantly, any involved in allowing the fraud to exist should also pay hefty fines personally.|I don't know why everyone is picking on JPM/Chase, they are just like all the other big banks who blink their eyes at big money. Most of the "bankers" can't spell integrity or honesty. They never get beyond ME,ME,ME.|I do hope many of these JP folk share "Bernie's vacation club" and the bank is forced to split into smaller parts and no longer be able to trade their investor's money. Not holding my breath, can't trust the feds to do the right thing.|Since the Supremes are so hot on treating corporations as persons, lets carry that thru to the logical conclusion. Last time I checked, a mass murderer could not just get off with a minor fine and continue on with business as usual just because a very small part of his brain prompted him to commit mayhem!! Send JPMC to the firing squad and sell off its dead body piece by piece.|Should we be surprised? JP Morgan history redounds with crookedness, even as early as the Civil War, when he (Morgan) sold rifles known to be defective for huge profits, killed an injured many soldiers and got off scot free. Nothing has changed. Nor will it, until someone gets a hefty jail term. NEVER HAPPEN!|It amazes me that people would still do business with the likes of JPMC. I guess they just like to be screwed. JP cares for nothing but itself and more pointedly the individual for him/herself. It is clear that parts of the bank have no idea what other parts are doing. It is beyond time to break this thing up and jail a number of their employees(thieves). The fact that is hasn't been so far just shows how well spent their money was in buying the SEC and DOJ.|JP Morgan Chase definitely an unholy group of lilly-livered thieves and gangsters which is above all, too big NOT to ever be allowed to engage in banking practices again.|Why wouldn't the RICO statutes apply in connection with the JPMC-BLM contrived fraud? Bernie Madoff never could have perpetrated his fraudulent scheme(s) to the extent he did without JPMC's complicity. They saw what was obvious to many others and simply ignored what they saw while pocketing some $500,000,000!|Are there any violations of law or oversight of due diligence that JPM has not run over in the last 5 years ? Yet Jamie Dimon is still perceived as the "rock star" of the big money center banks.|Off hand I can not cite, in dollars, how much JPM has had to cough up for it's wanton negligence in oversight but that number along with the attendant gross mis-management is the best argument there could be for separation of president and board chairman.......|But you will see, nothing will happen with JP and the other banks. They will go on as if nothing happened. And the authorities and the government will do nothing to stop them. They might even make the fine tax deductible.|Others may answer this question differently, but IMHO both JPM and BOA are training/tolerating their management and employees hosing their customers. If that is so, this cant end well for the customers, or the investors OR THE EMPLOYEES. It may well take years, even a decade or two but the establishment of this kind of culture has one inevitable conclusion. Customers and investors will get hosed.|My Christmas wish is that somehow, however painful it may be for JPM shareholders, that JPM is held accountable for the massive fraud that Madoff set off.|Greed knows no color, creed or religion. I worked for Chase (NYC) prior to the many mergers (Manufacture's Hanover.. JP Morgan) and watched corporate global ethics and bank operating cultures change dramatically. Working in the systems department we created from scratch plastic card processing, and ATM 24 hour banking among many other supporting systems. The culture then was to design systems and protect the bank and our customers. One day we were let go and the culture became use the systems, make money, and remove any impediments to client operations. This was an avalanche designed by purpose serving bank and customer greed.. It's that simple.|I would advise everyone to stop doing business with that "bank". If you know they are not trustworthy why do business with them or buy any of their products? If the people would behave in an ethical way JPM would already be gone. But since money and greed rules the world nothing will change.|As MF is concerned, I personally would immediatly stop doing any coverage for JPM because of ethical reasons. Just like they did with SQM. That was ethical behaviour at it's best.

In addition to the general uncertainty regarding government policy, the companies have had to contend with rumors and false attributions that have materially dampened sales.|Coke was India's leading soft drink until it was booted out of the country in 1977 for refusing to reveal its secret formula. Then, in 2003, India's Center for Science and Environment, or CSE, published a study that showed Coke and Pepsi contained pesticide residues. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo disputed the study and the results eventually faded from the public eye, but it caused an adverse reaction that hurt both companies' brands. Coca-Cola also received poor publicity in India due to its zealous use of water in a region where water is scarce.

The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, growth in earnings per share, increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and notable return on equity. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."|AT&T INC has improved earnings per share by 14.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that this trend should continue.

This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.48 versus $1.21).|The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior.

The company owns a major stake in an LNG terminal in Angola that shipped its first LNG this past summer. By all accounts, it was a painful journey to get to that point. The company experienced 18 months of delays for a variety of reasons before the first LNG carrier cast off. However, Chevron undoubtedly learned from the experience and can minimize delays in its two other LNG terminals.|These other terminals are the Wheatstone in Australia and the Kitimat in Western Canada. Both terminals will be fed by Chevron-owned natural gas assets in their respective countries. The Kitimat, by some estimates, will be exporting natural gas as early as 2015, with larger facilities coming online in 2018. The Wheatstone is slated to begin exports in 2018.|All three terminals give Chevron exposure to the Asian natural gas market. The Angola terminal already ships LNG to Japan and China. The Wheatstone and Kitimat hope to exploit their respective geographies to bring LNG to Asia with favorable economics regarding both natural gas price differentials and shipping costs. These terminals add to Chevron's portfolio of natural gas assets in China, Vietnam, and Thailand.|ExxonMobil's natural gas interests extend to Australia. The big news here is that the Kipper Tuna Turrum on Australia's east coast began delivering natural gas in October. This gas is meant for domestic use. For export purposes, ExxonMobil owns a 25% stake in the Gorgon natural gas project slated in Northwestern Australia. This project is 47% owned by Chevron, by the way.|Final Foolish thoughtsAnadarko's Mozambique terminal should start shipping up to 50 million tons of LNG in 2018. This compares to the 61 million tons ExxonMobil currently ships from Qatar each year. While Anadarko won't beat either Chevron or ExxonMobil for export capacity, it should operate profitably in this business.

Quite frequently we hear stories of boards that are filled with "yes" men who parrot the views of the CEO. But sometimes appointments can really bring something to the table, and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) may have done just that with the addition of Jon Huntsman Jr., who will join the board of directors effective Jan. 15. Many people may remember Huntsman's name from the 2012 Republican presidential primaries and as the governor of Utah, but what Chevron probably values are things that most of us don't know about him. Let's take a look at what Huntsman could bring to the table with Chevron.|Ease on down the value chainIf the name Huntsman sounds familiar, that's because he is a son of the founder of chemical company Huntsman (NYSE: HUN) , where his brother is the acting CEO and he sits on the board of directors. With the recent surge in natural gas -- and more importantly for the chemical manufacturing industry, ethane -- here in the U.S., several of the integrated majors are looking to increase their presence in chemical manufacturing. Chevron is no exception. Through its partnership with Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) , the company plans on building a 1.5 million ton per year ethane-cracking facility in the Gulf Coast region. This facility will cost more than $5 billion by the time it is completed and will represent one of Chevron's largest investments in the downstream side of its operations in many years.|Combine this new facility with incorporating Huntsman on the board and it could signal that the company is looking to take a greater leap into the downstream side of the business. One reason this is happening is because Chevron and other Big Oil companies missed the boat when it came to shale oil and gas, and one of the ways companies can still capture value from this major shift in the American energy landscape is to be in a position to consume all that cheap natural gas. With extremely deep pockets, Big Oil has the ability to finance these major projects much easier than some of the independent oil and gas producers or some of the smaller chemical companies.|Dealing with the dragonThe other critical element Huntsman can bring to the table is relationships he has in the Asia Pacific market. In his political career he has acted as the U.S. ambassador to both Singapore and China, and there are very few countries out there more valuable to an energy company than China. Also, his presence could not come at a more critical time for Chevron.|For the past couple years, Chevron and PetroChina (NYSE: PTR) have been developing a $6.4 billion in a very high risk natural-gas project. The Chuandongbei gas project is both a high-pressure field and contains very high level of hydrogen sulfide. Recently, the two partners have not exactly seen eye to eye and have suspended the expansion phases of the project until this part can get up and running. PetroChina originally estimated the project to be completed in 2010, but it has suffered many delays including a blowout that killed more than 240 people from hydrogen sulfide poisoning.|This is by far and away Chevron's largest project in China, and its success will more than likely be a large determinant on future projects in China. This is important because estimates put China's shale-gas deposits at more than 36 trillion cubic feet, the largest in the world. Also, the major players in China do not have shale gas drilling expertise, so they will need to work with other players. Both Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) and Hess (NYSE: HES) have both inked major development deals in China, and Chevron will likely be vying for other Chinese projects down the road. Having Jon Huntsman in Chevron's corner could go a long way in navigating the political climate in China.|What a Fool believesNew board appointees can fly under the radar, but when a high-profile addition like this one comes around, investors should be aware of what it could mean for the company. In the case of Chevron, it is very likely this could signal that the company wants to expand its presence in China as well as its downstream footprint. If Chevron were to start developing China's shale gas on top of its already large position in Argentina's shale gas, it could put the company at the forefront of expanding unconventional gas drilling outside the U.S.

As of 2:30 p.m. EST, the Dow's right under the breakeven point, with its 30 member stocks split fairly evenly between risers and losers. Despite the mixed day, both Merck (NYSE: MRK) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) are managing respectable gains for investors, respectively moving higher by 0.14% and 0.61%,. Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Merck breezes past the FDA's panelAn FDA advisory committee gave the thumbs-up to one of Merck's developmental drugs yesterday, giving some welcome relief to investors. The panel unanimously voted to support approval of Merck's allergy and immunotherapy drug Grastek on both the therapy's efficacy and its safety, although the committee did raise some concerns over the drug's safety effects on children. The panel advised a further study on safety effects for younger children, along with backing the drug's safety profile on the condition that patients be afforded access to epinephrine, which is used to treat emergency allergic reactions. .|Grastek's not exactly a savior in pill form for Merck: Analysts peg peak sales of the drug only between $150 million and $350 million, so it's hardly a blockbuster candidate. Still, with the criticism Merck's research and development division has faced during the past year -- and the cost-cutting, job-slashing shake-up that followed in October -- it's a good sign for investors that the company managed to get this drug approved by the advisory panel. Grastek still has to obtain regulators' approval, but with a unanimous backing in both efficacy and safety it seems a lock to clear that final hurdle.

Both are dying categories, the first because of obesity and diabetes and the second because, well, who knows what, but if you go to the doctor, s/he will tell you not to drink diet sodas.

This week, Austin's incumbent telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) opened up a high-speed Internet package at prices comparable to Google Fiber, and with speeds reaching gigabit parity in 2014.|Today's blue-plate Internet special, with a side of privacy invasion Before diving into what this means for Google, let's take a closer look at AT&T's product. For $99 a month, Austin residents will get a fiber-optic connection running at 300 megabits per second, upped to 1 gigabit for no additional cost next year.|AT&T's 300-megabit solutions are available today (again, upgraded to 1 gigabit for free next year), while Google Fiber installations are scheduled for the summer of 2014. Google Fiber prices in Kansas City are comparable to AT&T's "premier" pricing, even if you add $50 a month to include TV services to each package.|The trade-off? AT&T will analyze your Web-browsing habits and send you personalized advertising in exchange for the lower pricing. I suppose AT&T sees the tailored ads as a value-added product, justifying the "premier" name.|That caveat to AT&T's lower pricing reminds me of two very different things:|The recently unveiled NSA efforts to collect intelligence on international terrorists, which also gather a ton of data on regular Americans. Keep in mind that AT&T doesn't deny allegations that the company is getting paid something like $10 million a year to supply the NSA and CIA with customer data. Instead, AT&T insists that nobody needs to know about these breaches of the company's own privacy policy.|How does that even work?It's unclear exactly how AT&T will collect the search terms and other information it would need in order to place personalized ads on your desktop. The company did tell GigaOm that it will use "various methods to collect Web-browsing information," but that encrypted pages using the HTTPS protocol are off limits.|That might mean forcing "premier" gigabit customers to use an AT&T-approved search engine, among other things. All Google searches are encrypted by default, so Ma Bell wouldn't be able to read that data even if it wanted to. By contrast, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Bing cheerfully presents search boxes and results over a basic HTTP connection, leaving off that crucial S as in "secure." Bing doesn't seem to work with HTTPS at all, actually. The Yahoo! search tool does offer a Bing-powered search experience over encrypted HTTPS connections, but the vanilla Bing site just doesn't play that tune. And even so, Yahoo! searches still default to unencrypted HTTP transports.|I'd expect the cheaper AT&T installation process to include a quick change to your browser's default search engine, away from the ever-popular Google and over to either the Microsoft or Yahoo! flavors of Bing. Or AT&T could write its own wrapper around Bing, providing Ma Bell's own branding alongside unencrypted searches.|What does this Austin adventure mean in Mountain View? Getting back to Google investors, this is a win for Big G even if AT&T wants to mitigate it with a custom search experience that doesn't include Google.|The whole Google Fiber project was never meant to blanket the nation in Google-owned fiber connections. Rather, it's meant to prod other Internet service providers like AT&T into offering cheaper, faster, better connectivity. That's compatible with Google's overarching vision to change the world via improved Internet services, and also feeds Google's own coffers, as hyper-connected consumers tend to click on more ads.|But again, AT&T wants to remove Google's benefits from a faster fiber service in Austin. It's also an interesting test of exactly how creeped-out American consumers really are by the Edward Snowden saga.|Will the tech-savvy Austin community trade some privacy for a $30 monthly discount on gigabit Internet connections? Will the Texans take AT&T's tainted service today, or wait a few months for an alternative that stands up for privacy rights? Only time will tell.

In back-to-back skirmishes, the Seattle giant lost two bidding wars to its rival.|First, formerly loyal customer VivaAerobus in Mexico gave $4 billion worth of plane orders to Airbus rather than to Boeing. Then, in an even bigger bruise to Boeing's ego (and its bank account), Japan Airlines gave Airbus a contract for $9.5 billion worth of planes. Add it up, and that's $13.5 billion worth of revenue (at list prices, which are usually heavily discounted) that should have been Boeing's for the taking -- but that got taken by Airbus instead.|Ouch!Ouch is right. Now, Boeing isn't taking this lying down. Turnabout is fair play in the airplane wars, and Boeing's fighting back. Last night, we learned that Boeing has swiped one of Airbus' traditional customers. Boeing won a firm order from Air Canada -- a traditional bastion of Airbus-buying -- for a total of 61 737 MAX planes, worth $6.5 billion at list prices.|But that's still just half of the sales Boeing lost in the VivaAerobus and JAL deals. So yes -- lately, Boeing has been doing only about half as well as its rival.|Granted, Boeing still has a chance to close the gap. In addition to ordering 61 planes "firm", Air Canada also took out "options" and "rights" to buy 48 more Boeings at a later date. These follow-on orders could potentially add as much as 80% to the size of the Air Canada deal.|737, looming large in Airbus's rearview mirror. Source: Boeing.|What's more worrisome than the sales numbers, though, is what all this infighting and customer-swiping might mean to the bottom lines at both Boeing and Airbus. After all, when an airline invests billions of dollars in buying one airplane maker's planes for its fleet, it makes a big commitment -- in configuring facilities to service one type of plane, in training its mechanics to work on these planes, and training its pilots to fly them. Switching horses midstream is not a decision an airline makes lightly. It needs a big incentive -- a big financial incentive -- to push it to make the switch.|How big?It stands to reason that every time Airbus steals a customer from Boeing, it does so at a cost -- a cost measured in discounts to list price and weakened profit margins. Similarly, in stealing Air Canada away from Airbus, Boeing may have been forced to make significant concessions.|How big might those concessions have been? Historically, airlines making large unit purchases of aircraft have negotiated substantial discounts as a matter of course. When Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY) made a similar-sized purchase of 70 Boeing 737s back in 2005, for example, it reportedly got the planes' list prices cut in half -- and that was with Boeing selling planes to an existing customer. (According to The New York Times, Ryanair scored another 50% off sale in its larger, 175-plane purchase earlier this year). You've got to figure that, before switching allegiances from Airbus, Air Canada bargained at least as hard with Boeing.|As it turns out, we know for a fact that Air Canada drove a hard bargain with Boeing. In order to win the Air Canada order, Boeing had to make the unusual promise to buy 20 of Air Canada's 45 Embraer190 jets off of the airline. As for the dollars-and-cents concessions Boeing was forced to make, the proof will be in the profit margins.|It really bothers me when US bloggers can't wait to but a negative title on an article such as this one. If you only read the title you could come to the conclusion that Boeing is only half as good as air bus. Why would anyone put an article title like this one from a so called reputable company like Motley Fool?

In the end, Boeing (NYSE: BA) won the contest, as Air Canada placed an order for 33 Boeing 737MAX 8 aircraft, and 28 larger Boeing 737MAX 9 aircraft for a total order of 61 jets valued at more than $6 billion.|Bloomberg notes this selection as particularly significant for Boeing, because it has allowed the manufacturer to break into Air Canada's narrowbody fleet, a fleet previously dominated by Airbus, a subsidiary of European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company. Air Canada already operates many Boeing models in its widebody fleet, and is aggressively promoting the introduction of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, scheduled to begin in early 2014.|American orderIn building the world's largest airline, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) has been very aggressive when it comes to fleet modernization. In mid 2011, the airline placed a $40 billion order for 460 jets in a massive order split between Boeing and Airbus. In November of that year, American declared bankruptcy, but the order was allowed to continue as part of the way to make a reorganized American Airlines more viable.|Future ordersLooking toward the future, Boeing may have greater opportunities in Air Canada's narrowbody fleet if the airline does another round of fleet modernization. However, the next priority for Air Canada will be the decision for a regional jet order setting up tough competition in this sub-industry.|American's decision to split its 2011 order between Boeing and Airbus, and its most recent order between Embraer and Bombardier, signifies that American is willing to have a fleet diverse in manufacturers. Therefore, future orders from American also carry a great possibility of being split between multiple manufacturers. Aerospace manufacturing investors should keep this in mind next time there are reports that American is getting ready to place an order.

UnitedHealth's (NYSE: UNH) having a tough day as well, with shares dropping 1.3%. Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Cisco sees a gloomier futureCisco started off today's fall by slashing its three-to-five-year earnings-per-share growth projection to between 5% and 7% from an earlier forecast of between 7% and 9%. Additionally, Cisco sliced its revenue forecast for that time to between 3% and 6% growth from an earlier range of between 5% and 7% growth.|The company noted that it's had trouble in emerging markets lately while also seeing its network equipment business -- Cisco's primary segment -- stalling out in growth. Indeed, Cisco's product revenue, which made up more than 77% of total sales as of the most recent quarter, saw merely 1.1% growth for the quarter, only about 25% of what the company's service revenue growth achieved.|However, there are a few bright spots for Cisco. CEO John Chambers noted that the U.S. economy is beginning to bounce back fully from the devastating blows of the recession, and that's a great point for Cisco. The company made more than 60% of its total revenue from the Americas in its most recent quarter, and sales growth jumped 4.2% during that time in its highest-growing region, enough to outpace the 8.7% year-over-year sales drop seen in Cisco's Asia-Pacific region. Despite Cisco's lagging growth, the stock still has plenty of value as a strong dividend pick, with a 3.2% dividend yield at just a 36% dividend payout ratio.

(CSCO: Quote) on Thursday trimmed its long-term growth guidance for adjusted earnings and revenues over the next three to five years, citing the weakness in emerging markets and product transitions.|This was revealed in a presentation by Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni at the Cisco Financial Analyst Conference 2013 in New York.|While reporting financial results for the first quarter in November, the company had warned that it expects revenues for the quarter to decline 8 to 10 percent, and said it expects adjusted earnings in a range of $0.45 to $0.47 per share. Cisco also warning on a revenue decline in the coming quarters.|The first-quarter profit decline marked the first time in eight quarters that Cisco's profit has dropped year-over-year. The company had been struggling with rising costs that threatened to derail its earnings growth. To reduce costs, Cisco cut thousands of jobs. In August, Cisco said it would cut 4,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its global workforce, to "rebalance" its employee base.|Cisco is viewed as a technology-industry bellwether because it dominates the market for routers and switches.

It's is still down 0.37% at 3:27 p.m. EST, in part because of a drop in tech giant Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) stock.|Cisco disappoints again Chief Financial Officer Frank Calderoni said today Cisco Systems expects to grow revenue 3%-6% over the next three to five years, which was lower than a previous forecast of 5%-7%. The fear is that competition from lower-cost networking equipment providers will limit Cisco's growth in the future; that may be what Calderoni is already forecasting.|The days of double-digit growth may be in the past, but let's not lose sight of the fact that Cisco is a highly profitable company that spits out lots of cash each year.|Time to buy Cisco Systems The market can often react strongly when guidance doesn't meet expectations, but in the case of Cisco I see another overreaction to a stock that's a great value. Management could do more to return cash to shareholders, and if it does even a slow growth rate will make for a great stock return.

Instead Cisco head of sales Chuck Robbins will travel to China every quarter and Chambers himself as well as Rob Lloyd, president of development and sales, will take turns visiting China to help improve relationships. Chambers also said Owen Chang, Cisco's chief executive of greater China, has the patience needed to help improve the company's business there.|Cisco's efforts in China "will be a series of quiet moves," rather than something that would be quickly noticeable, said Chambers. He said that "the Chinese send messages very subtly. Who sits beside who at a table, who you meet when you go to China, who you don't meet ... And do you do joint ventures or not, what key market opportunities do you have."|However, Cisco has had a bitter rivalry with China's Huawei|by Cisco about a decade ago.|Chambers would not say if he thought Cisco's difficulties in China came in retaliation after the U.S. government effectively banned the sale of Huawei's equipment here last year.|NEW YORK, Dec 12- Cisco Systems Chief Executive John Chambers said on Thursday that the network equipment company is preparing for a long battle to improve its business in China, one that will not be won "in a quarter or two."

LaSorda (no relation to the Hall of Fame baseball manager) had been Chrysler CEO in the waning days of Daimler ownership and his climb to the pinnacle of the company was a triumphant moment, if short-lived. He grew up in a small house, one of nine siblings, across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario, where his father built minivans in the Chrysler factory that could be seen from his front porch. Now LaSorda was second banana to Bob Nardelli, the well-dressed, smooth-talking former General Electric Co. (GE) and Home Depot Inc. (HD) executive Cerberus had installed as CEO in August 2007. Nardelli, recognizing LaSorda knew the car business better than he did, asked him to find a savior for the automaker.|So LaSorda turned to the company where he worked for 23 years before joining Chrysler in 2000: General Motors. In late August, LaSorda convened a secret meeting with GM President Fritz Henderson to discuss a megamerger. Each company's shrinking cash was already causing bankruptcy buzz. "The idea was how could we combine these two companies and create a big synergy," recalled LaSorda, now 59. Joining forces could strengthen them and make them the largest auto company in the world -- a title GM was losing to Toyota (TM). Bob Lutz, by then GM's vice chairman and head of product development, worked with Henderson to identify how much money could be saved. Said Lutz: "Fritz and I, being conservative, estimated at least $9 billion to $12 billion in savings in the first year."|"They would have wiped out Chrysler," LaSorda said. "The only winners would have been General Motors and the banks. And the people at Chrysler would have lost. When it came to that, we just told them to get lost."

Despite the U.S. economy going through a challenging period, Johnson & Johnson has been able to deliver return on equity of at least 16.2% during the last five years, being as high as 30% back in 2008.|This highlights the quality of Johnson & Johnson: It is able to deliver high levels of profitability during tough economic times, and maintain a level of consistency that compares favorably with pharmaceutical sector peers such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co. Furthermore, such consistency could be a great thing for a retirement portfolio, because it indicates that Johnson & Johnson has a large degree of longevity, which is crucial when investing for the long haul.|Keeping debt levels lowIn addition, Johnson & Johnson remains a quality company right through to the way it's financed. It carries only a small amount of debt, with the debt to equity ratio standing at just 24.9% at the end of its most recent financial year (December 30 2012).|With the wider U.S. indices tracking ever higher, and good value stocks tough to come by, Johnson & Johnson looks to be a potent mix of value and quality that could book you on that plane to Florida a little earlier than you'd expect.

That's despite the fact that JPMorgan Chase and most of its peers have been hit with one fine after another to pay for the sins of the financial crisis.|That's because most have already eliminated the proprietary trading desks that Volcker prohibits and are employing other tactics, such as JPMorgan's 'it's a hedge defense,' to continue making risky bets with house money.|Even though many of the settlements sound like a lot of money, such as JPMorgan Chase's $13 billion over allegations of fraudulent mortgage-backed securities, the banks have all set aside enough cash to cover their litigation costs.

Madoff, striking tentative deals that would involve roughly $2 billion in penalties and a rare criminal action. The government will use a sizable portion of the money to compensate Mr. Madoff's victims.|The agreement to deferred prosecution would also list the bank's criminal violations in a court filing but stop short of an indictment as long as JPMorgan pays the penalties and acknowledges the facts of the government's case. In the negotiations, the prosecutors discussed the idea of extracting a guilty plea from JPMorgan, the people said, but ultimately chose the steep fine and deferred-prosecution agreement, which could come by the end of the year.|Until now, no big Wall Street bank has ever been subjected to such an agreement, which is typically deployed only when misconduct is severe. JPMorgan, the authorities suspect, continued to serve as Mr. Madoff's primary bank even as questions mounted about his operation, with one bank executive acknowledging before the arrest that Mr. Madoff's "Oz-like signals" were "too difficult to ignore," according to a private lawsuit.|JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this article, has repeatedly said that "all personnel acted in good faith" in the Madoff matter. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of wrongdoing and the bank was not the only one to miss Mr. Madoff's fraud, which duped regulators and clients for decades.|The looming settlements would come on the heels of JPMorgan's reaching a record $13 billion settlement over its sale of troubled mortgage securities before the financial crisis.|The scrutiny has taken a toll on JPMorgan, undercutting its leverage in negotiations and casting the bank as a symbol of Wall Street risk-taking. That stigma also sapped the influence that JPMorgan once used to shape policy in Washington, people briefed on the matter said, where regulators are increasingly skeptical of the bank's lobbying.

Does that trend make Merck a better buy than Bristol?|Debating earningsThe ability to translate sales into fatter profit fuels acquisitions, research and development, dividend payments, and share buybacks. That's especially important to these two companies, given that each is navigating stiff headwinds from high-profile patent expirations. Merck lost protection for its $5 billion-a-year blockbuster drug Singulair, and Bristol lost protection for its blockbuster drug Plavix last year.|To offset falling sales, each company is cutting costs to improve margin. Merck announced plans in October to reduce its employee count by 20% in a bid to shave $2.5 billion in expenses. Bristol announced in November that it was letting 75 people go from its R&D team as it shutters work in three disease areas to focus on late-stage oncology and immunotherapy programs.|Those moves will likely help Merck and Bristol capture bigger profits once new drugs come to market, including Merck's MK-3475 and Bristol's daclatisvir, which has been filed for approval as a treatment for hepatitis C in Japan.|Bristol, with historical operating margin near 30%, has been better than Merck at converting sales into profit. The two swapped places earlier this year as Bristol struggled following the Plavix expiration. However, Bristol's margin moved back above Merck's in the third quarter.|Bristol's third-quarter pop in margin appears to have caught analysts flat-footed, allowing Bristol to outpace their forecast by 4.5%. Merck beat analysts by a similar amount, it's 4th consecutive quarter of over-delivering earnings.|Merck|Despite Merck and Bristol's solid bottom-line performance this year, analysts remain pessimistic about 2014. The Street has cut its earnings outlook for Merck from $3.68 per share to $3.49 over the past 90 days. And they've lowered forecasts for Bristol from $2.01 to $1.94.|Those cuts are likely driven by worries over another wave of patent expirations, which include Merck's oncology drug Temodar. That drug had $900 million in sales last year. Bristol's Baraclude, used to treat hepatitis B, raked in $1.4 billion in sales during 2012, of which $241 million came from sales in the United States. Those U.S. sales could face generic competition soon, following the invalidation of Baraclude's patent this past February.|Merck|Investors' appetite for Merck and Bristol is big, with the price-to-sales ratio for both hitting or nearing five-year highs. That suggests growth from fast-growing drugs like Bristol's Yervoy and up-and-coming drugs such as Merck's MK-3475 is already being priced in.|If we consider price-to-earnings ratios, investors are more willing to pay up for Bristol's future earnings than they are Merck's. Bristol is trading at 26 times next year's estimates, handily above the 16.7 average levels it's traded at over the past five years. Merck investors are a bit more sanguine. They're paying just 14 times future earnings -- far less than they've paid over the past five years.|Merck|Yet when we consider P/E to growth ratios, or PEG, which measures price to earnings and expected future growth, we see Bristol, with a PEG ratio of just 0.63, appears more reasonably priced than Merck. That said, investors have never been willing to overpay for growth at these two companies, which is evidenced by low PEG ratios over the past five years.|That suggests trailing P/E ratios are more likely to move back to long-term averages than remain at lofty levels. If we assume that will prove true in the case at Merck, it's more likely we'll see a price closer to 15 or 16 times earnings than 30 times. At Bristol, it's more likely P/E ratios will drop back into the teens too.|If that happens, then Bristol's shares appear overvalued based on next year's earnings, while Merck's appear undervalued by 11%. Of course, those assumptions may prove wrong, and could vary widely based on how well these two execute on late stage trials. But they give you a good starting point for determining how expensive or cheap the two companies may be.|Merck|Over at Merck, investors may be underestimating the company's potential to right the ship in the wake of lower sales tied to patent expiration. But that undervaluation exists only If Merck can hit its goal on cost cuts, and succeed in bringing MK-3475 and other new drugs to market.

But not all of the Dow's blue chip components have been equal this year. Take big pharma household name Merck (NYSE: MRK) : While Merck's beaten the Dow and had a great year, this stock's fallen into the bottom half of the index among year-to-date performers, and trails some of its biggest health-care rivals in 2013. What's gone right (and wrong) for Merck this year? Let's take a look back at 12 months of progress for one of the biggest names in the health-care business.|The patent cliff's huge hitIt's safe to say that Merck has struggled with the patent cliff this year, but it's been a big problem across all of big pharma. Merck's chief rival and fellow Dow member Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has seen its sales slide behind falling revenue from cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor. Pfizer's former top seller lost patent protection last year, and has seen revenue plunge 49% year-over-year through 2013's first months.|Same story at Merck, although the company's big patent-cliff loss, Singulair, has suffered a much bigger blow. Singulair, a treatment for asthma and respiratory illnesses, has seen its sales drop off by 74% year over year through the first nine months of 2013 -- a loss of more than $2 billion in revenue.|Meanwhile, stagnating growth from some of Merck's more promising drugs have led to Singulair's blows being felt with extra vigor. Diabetes duo Januvia and Janumet are this company's stars for the next several years, but they haven't performed that way for Merck in 2013. Januvia, already the recipient of more than $2.8 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, has seen its sales slip slightly over that period of time. Januvia and Janumet still have room to run, but sliding revenue wasn't what Merck had in mind for its top diabetes drugs heading into this year.|Shaking up developmentIf Januvia's sluggishness hasn't been bad enough, Merck has taken hits in its pipeline, as well. The biggest news from Merck's R&D division in 2013 came all the way back in February, when the company announced that it would delay the FDA filing of promising bone treatment odanacatib until 2014. That unnerved many investors, despite the promise odanacatib still offers. Many analysts peg the compound, if approved, at peak sales of more than $1 billion, and odanacatib's chances of passing the FDA look very good.|However, Merck's lackluster pipeline drew more and more criticism as the year went on. It's for much more than just the odanacatib misfire, too. Merck spends more on its R&D as a portion of sales than some of its competitors, and for less results. In 2012, for instance, Merck spent 17.2% of its total revenue on research and development. That was a far greater sum than rival Pfizer, which spent only 13.3% of its total revenue on R&D -- and Pfizer's pipeline is one of the best in the business.|The good news going forward is that investors forced Merck's hand in October. The company announced job cuts and savings, and half of the latter will come from R&D. Overall, the plan's expected to save Merck around $2.5 billion annually by 2015. That's desperately needed for this firm, as Merck looks to counter the effects of Singulair's loss, and further upcoming patent expirations in coming years.|A year stuck in neutralMerck's stock might have done well overall for investors in 2013, but it's been an up-and-down year for the company. Odanacatib's filing delay was more of a nuiscance than real trouble, but Januvia's slowdown, and Singulair's colossal patent-cliff-related hit, have taken a toll on Merck's financials. While the company's savings and cost-cutting plan should help into the future, Merck needs to light a fire under its R&D division to find its next great drugs -- all while keeping its current crop of products on the market selling at peak performance.|How you can maximize your financial performance in the new yearWhile Merck's been a good stock this year, there's a huge difference between a good stock and a stock that can make you rich.

It's still a wait-and-see situation for insurance investors as the new law progresses, but right now, Obamacare's tepid launch shows that playing health-care reform is the right move for insurers.

Financing is just a more transparent model. In fact, Apple could benefit if the result is that upgrade cycles shorten, since new upgrade programs allow users to upgrade very 12 to 18 months instead of waiting a full two years.

Shares of the networking equipment maker dipped as much as 2.6% overnight. What did it take to slash nearly $3 billion off a Dow component's market cap?|Tech analyst Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup started covering Cisco with a sell rating and an $18 price target, more than 15% below Tuesday's closing price.|On top of the expected sector weakness, Gelblum thinks Cisco is losing market share even outside China, mostly to French-American rival Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU) . The Citi analyst recognizes that his views are unusually pessimistic.|Gelblum's rating is new because he recently joined Citigroup. In his previous gig at Morgan Stanley, Gelblum held a neutral rating on Cisco when the stock cratered in 2010 and 2011, then switched to a buy rating just as Cisco bounced off a temporary bottom. Following his advice on Cisco throughout the Morgan Stanley stint, investors would have nearly doubled the Dow's returns over almost two years.|I would agree with his telecom equipment view, but am scratching my head over the sudden love for Alcatel-Lucent. That company has been in hard-core turnaround mode for the last several years, relying on fresh debt and asset sales to stay afloat. Yes, Alcatel knows how to build a fine high-speed router, but so does Cisco. The occasional sale might fall through to Alcatel, saving the smaller rival's long-term bacon, but I see no reason why telecoms everywhere would suddenly prefer a vendor with precarious finances over one with billions in the bank and a history of market dominance.|So take this particular note with a grain of French sea salt. Cisco may be losing some market share to Alcatel-Lucent and others, but hardly enough to justify a 15% share price plunge. Chances are, the market already priced in all the signs of Cisco's recent troubles.|"The sad fact is that the MBAs have killed this once great engineering and product company. Cisco's outsourcing, continued reorgs, rampant ethnic nepotism, and low standards for recruiting technical talent have brought internal product development to a near complete halt. Cisco is quickly losing the ability to design and ship new products.|"Despite spending Billions on engineering, Cisco has very little to show for it in terms of new, organic products. Cisco hasn't shipped a new architecturally significant, organic product in years. Cisco struggles just to organize and maintain its technical staff for bug fixes and maintenance on its rapidly ageing existing architectures.|"Cisco has become so deranged that recently large parts of the company have organized into a structure that looks a lot like the previously failed "Board's and Councils" model under a different name.|"The long term prospect for Cisco on the product side looks really grim from inside the company.

Fact is, even if Alcatel has products capable of competing with Cisco, the French company's total lack of any cushion in its profit margins means that Cisco can underprice the competition at will.|Meanwhile, Cisco stock itself continues to look very attractive indeed.

Since the index's lowest ebb, its overseers have replaced six components, and the Dow has surged from below 7,000 points to more than 16,000 points for the first time in its history. Due to the index's price-weighting structure, some stocks have had a far greater impact on that rise than others -- and few have had a bigger effect than Home Depot (NYSE: HD) which has been the Dow's best-performing nonfinancial component from the day the market's rebound began:|It's been a great streak for Home Depot shareholders, who have enjoyed a modest but undeniable rebound in the American housing market in recent years, but savvy investors would rather look forward to the gains yet to come than dwell on the gains they've already known. Will the world's largest home improvement retailer thrive in 2014 as it has in 2013, or are the winds of change beginning to blow against it again?|The year ahead: by the numbers Home Depot's earned its gains over the past few years, as its bottom line has surged higher at an impressive rate for such a massive retailer:|Sources: Morningstar and company press releases. * 2013 EPS result and growth rate are based on Home Depot's latest estimates.|Home Depot released updated guidance for the upcoming 2014 fiscal year just this morning, and its projected 17% earnings-per-share growth above its anticipated 2013 earnings shows the company taking a cautious tack. However, its nothing to sneeze at, especially given Home Depot's strategy of underpromising and overdelivering -- its earliest guidance for fiscal 2013 was for EPS growth of just 12% from the 2012 fiscal year. With final guidance now set at twice that level, it's possible we could see 2014 produce a smashing 34% EPS growth rate, which would result in $4.98 in final earnings per share for the upcoming year.|Will Home Depot trounce its initial guidance once again? Analysts currently expect an 18% growth rate for the coming year, which is somewhat weaker than what they project for competitor Lowe's (a 22% growth rate), for large homebuilders Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) (a 48% growth rate) and Lennar (a 22% growth rate), for paint maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) (a 20% growth rate), or for smaller home-improvement specialist Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL) (a 28% growth rate). Despite lower expectations -- which would still nevertheless be quite strong for any retailer or housing-related stock close to Home Depot's size -- the company still boasts a modestly elevated valuation, which is neck-and-neck with Lowe's and only significantly behind the two specialty retailers we've just examined:|However, of the four of these companies that have been profitable since the day the rebound began -- homebuilders have had a rough road back to profit after engaging in massive overbuilding during the subprime bubble -- Home Depot has experienced by far the least growth in its valuation:|This is a rather positive sign for Home Depot shareholders, who have far less to fear from their favorite housing-sector stock's valuation returning to a long-range average than do shareholders in other housing-related stocks. However, the threat of a taper in the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing effort -- widely believed to be in the cards for 2014 now that the unemployment rate has reached former Chairman Ben Bernanke's 7% target for ending the stimulus program -- could crimp growth throughout the housing sector by raising rock-bottom interest rates before once-bitten lenders get over their shyness toward the mortgage market. In fact, Home Depot's relatively steady share-price growth abruptly halted as soon as Bernanke began talking about tapering at the Fed's June press conference. Since that day, Home Depot's shares have lost roughly 2% even as the Dow itself has grown another 6%.|If and when the Fed winds down its asset-purchasing program, Home Depot shareholders may wind up with far more modest gains than they've been used to for the past four years. However, moderation of the red-hot growth in housing stocks is likely to have a more muted impact on Home Depot than it will on many others in the sector, due to its superior size and more stable long-term valuation. For long-term shareholders, Home Depot is likely to remain one of the best housing stocks on the market, even if its extended streak of beating the Dow comes to an end next year.

The interesting thing about this move was that there was no good catalyst for the decline. Very little news, let alone negative reports, could be found pertaining to the company. But trading volume was nearly double that of a normal day as 6.65 million shares traded hands while the rolling three-month average is only 3.9 million shares. This very likely is a sign that a large institutional investor was selling shares today.|While Nike lost 3% on no news, shares of lululemon athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) declined 1.11% as investors still weigh the company's recently announced changes. On Tuesday, Lululemon announced that Founder Chip Wilson will step down as chairman and that Laurent Potdevin will take outgoing CEO Christine Day's job. Potdevin was most recently the president of footwear brand TOMS Shoes and will likely help Lululemon globalize its brand, as he had a leading role in doing just that with TOMS. For months now, investors have had to worry about what the loose-tongued Wilson may say or do next. So both this change and the announcement of a new CEO should be seen as good things in shareholders' eyes.

Three catalysts, in particular -- a new deal with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) , a steady royalty from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) , and an expansion of manufacturing capacity -- drove progress in the past 12 months for this commercially focused company. Let's reflect in more detail.|That decision paid off for Repligen and investors in 2013. The company collected a cool $5 million upfront payment in January, and another $1 million milestone in September, from a licensing agreement with Pfizer. Only about 20% was attributed to this year's revenue, but clinical progress at Pfizer that occurred in the past 12 months is certainly an encouraging sign. The deal gives the pharma giant worldwide rights to Repligen's former spinal muscular atrophy program in return for $64 million in potential future milestone payments (on top of the aforementioned payments), and potential royalties on future sales.|Catalyst #2: Orencia royaltiesRoyalty payments for rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia from Bristol-Myers Squibb will generate about one-quarter of Repligen's total revenue this year. Unlike the licensing deal with Pfizer, Orencia royalties are the result of a legal settlement and, unfortunately, they'll end at the end of 2013. While that will result in lower total revenue in 2014, investors should know that the royalty stream was instrumental in building the company's $70 million cash pile. The war chest, which equates to about 17% of Repligen's market cap, will help fund growth for years to come.

Chevron plans two major LNG export terminals to feed the Asian market: one in Kitimat, Canada and the Wheatstone export terminal in Ashburton North, Australia. Both facilities boast geographic advantages over Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Dominion's Cove Point. Chevron hopes export operations from Wheatstone will begin in 2016. The company made no mention of a projected start date for its Kitimat terminal. Chevron owns a 50% stake in the Kitimat terminal with Apache Corporation owning the other 50%. Apache also owns a stake in the Wheatstone terminal.|One advantage Chevron offers investors is its LNG export experience. The company began shipping LNG from its Angola terminal this past summer, and China was one of the destinations. The project suffered 18 months of delays before finally coming online. In the process, Chevron likely learned a thing or two about getting an LNG terminal up and running. Presumably, its Wheatstone terminal is progressing smoother.|Australia and Russia look to add export capacity. Many of these projects should come online in 2016-2018, about the time Cheniere's first exports should begin. With its size, extensive operations in Asia, LNG experience and focus on growing its LNG business, Chevron looks tough to beat in the LNG market. While Cheniere may be first to export to Asia, in the end, Chevron may dominate the Asian LNG market.

Even as broader-based networking companies Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) have faced their own struggles, Ciena has managed to reverse year-ago losses in recent quarters, and hopes to keep doing so this quarter.|Ciena's products help enterprise customers speed up their network infrastructure, helping to manage what has recently become an increasingly massive volume of data gathered from data-analytics exercises and other applications. As Ciena's customers have shown signs of ramping up on their spending in the IT arena, it hopes that it can outpace Cisco and Juniper to take advantage of its narrower focus to get more than its proportionate share of great capital expenditures. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Ciena over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Ciena started off the quarter well, reporting better revenue and net income than investors had expected to see in its July quarter. CEO Gary Smith pointed directly to its specialization as a big driver of its results, as it managed to avoid the broader challenges that have held back Juniper, Cisco, and other larger companies from achieving the same growth rates. In particular, with wireless network giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) looking to ramp up on their spending to fill out their geographical footprints and provide wider coverage, Ciena expects to see even more growth in the future. Verizon has largely built out its LTE network, but it will still have to spend money to improve efficiency and make coverage denser. Meanwhile, AT&T is still behind in its LTE rollout, and will have to keep adding markets to provide customers with the coverage they want. Ciena should benefit from both of these companies' moves.|Yet many investors have made the mistake of lumping Ciena in with its larger rivals and their own challenges. In particular, Cisco has said that it expects its sales to decline in the current quarter, leading some to assume that telecom spending has fallen more than investors had expected. Yet even as shareholders pulled down Juniper and Ciena share prices in concert with Cisco's woes, there's reason to believe that Cisco's problems are company-specific, raising hope that Ciena will escape the slower trends that Cisco has seen.|In the Ciena earnings report, watch closely to see where the networking company's biggest revenue sources are. If the telecom industry comes through with expected spending boosts, then it should put to rest the Cisco-led fears for Ciena and produce more enthusiasm for the stock going forward.

Looking at the biggest decliners on the day, though, consumer stocks were well-represented, with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) all posting drops of more than 1%.|For the most part, none of these three companies came out with specific news explaining their declines. Home Depot rival Lumber Liquidatorsissued lackluster guidance, but that might just as easily be seen as a mark of confidence in Home Depot's stranglehold over the home-improvement industry. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble typically fly under investors' radars toward year-end, as consumer-oriented investors pay a lot more attention to retailers in their key holiday seasons to see if they'll stand up to intense competition and sales pressure.|Still, painting a broad brushstroke across the industry seems ill-advised. Home Depot doesn't seem to fit that mold particularly well, as it still has plenty of growth opportunities despite its mildly lofty P/E ratio. Home Depot is projected to grow at an 18% annual clip over the next five years, and as long as the housing market continues to move higher, Home Depot can expect more homeowners to have the capacity to make improvements and spend money at its stores.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/10/is-lumber-liquidators-a-screaming-buy-after-its-co.aspx|12/10/2013|0|"Home Depot"|2|How does Lumber Liquidators stack up against Home Depot and Lowe's?Compared to Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) , Lumber Liquidators is incredibly small. Right now, the company has a market capitalization of around $2.5 billion, far smaller than the $49.9 billion of Lowe's and almost microscopic when set against the $111 billion behemoth that is Home Depot. Despite the difference in size, the company has successfully competed with both of its peers, as demonstrated by its net profit margin.|Over the company's last five years, its net profit margin (the percent of every dollar in revenue that is converted into profit), has averaged 4.7%. This matches the 4.7% earned by Home Depot but outstrips the 4% earned by Lowe's. On top of comparable profitability, the company has demonstrated an amazing ability to grow. Looking at the same time horizon, revenue at the firm has jumped 68.7% from $482.2 million to $813.3 million.|In comparison, Home Depot was only able to grow by 4.9% while Lowe's brought up the rear with 4.8%. Admittedly, the disparity in growth is partially attributable to the market size of Home Depot and Lowe's compared to their smaller rival, but it should act as a warning signal to them that another player has learned how to compete on par even without the same market presence.|Foolish takeawayAs we can see, Lumber Liquidators is a small business compared to both Lowe's and Home Depot. Despite this, the company appears to be extremely healthy and growing, but not at the rate investors hoped it would. At 36 times earnings, the business is, by no means, cheap, but it would appear as though market participants are overreacting to the news of slightly lower guidance.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/10/are-home-improvement-stores-still-a-no-brainer.aspx|12/10/2013|0|"Home Depot"|1|Are Home Improvement Stores Still A No Brainer?|As housing approached its inevitable turnaround a couple of years back, it was a no brainer thesis that home improvement companies would benefit in line with the recovery. Home Depot's (NYSE: HD) stock has appreciated nearly 100% in two years, while Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) is just a few points behind at 92%. In recent periods, both companies have delivered stellar earnings and raised their forecasts for the future. Fortune Brands Home and Security (NYSE: FBHS) , the company behind major home goods names such as Masterlock , Moen Faucets, and Simonton Windows, has seen its shares travel up 150% in the same time. Of course, it's easy to spot a great investment when looking back in time. The question now is, has the market fully awarded the value of the housing recovery to home goods stocks?|Numbers-talkHome Depot, Lowe's, and Fortune Brands trade at forward earnings ratios of 18.01 times, 18.02 times and 21.6 times, respectively. P/E's are by no means the end-all of valuation of metrics, and even the rich-looking numbers are not to suggest that the companies' growth can't match, or even outperform. The figures do give us a few clues, though, as to how the market views the companies and what it offers investors.|Home Depot and Lowe's seem nearly indistinguishable by the market's view. The companies have both been coming in at or ahead of estimates, delivering strong guidance, appreciating in value at the same rate, and have a near identical forward valuation.|On an EV/EBITDA level, Fortune Brands is again the most richly valued at 18 times, with Home Depot at 11.1 times and Lowe's at 10.25 times. Price to sales puts Lowe's the cheapest at 0.95 times.|Given that the market views Home Depot and Lowe's so similarly (understandably so), and that the two businesses are likely to continue their mimicry of the gains in the housing industry, it makes sense to pick the better priced of the two.|When it comes down to it, all three companies are priced for decent growth and will likely hit those targets, barring a slowdown in the industry (unlikely). Fortune Brands isn't quite the same business as Home Depot and Lowe's, and has the advantage of solely owning great brands. It's a more predictable business than the retail stores of the latter two, and on a fundamental level is more attractive. But, for the investor looking to earn a mint on the undeniable fact that this country needs more housing, the cheaper plays, and Lowe's in particular, are still attractively priced.

However, the company still has spots of brightness in its old stomping grounds of diabetes. GLP-1 agent dulaglutide is a major prospect for Lilly with projected sales of $1.7 billion by 2020. Studies have shown the agent to beat both Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) Byetta and Merck's (NYSE: MRK) Januvia, but there already exists significant competition in the GLP-1 field, including diabetes leader Novo Nordisk's (NYSE: NVO) Victoza.

Instead, an asset swap with big pharma peer Merck (NYSE: MRK) might make more sense for the diversified drug maker, though the article made no mention of Merck's opinion in the matter. This interesting news rounds out a year of major pharmaceutical restructuring that saw Pfizer's spin off its own animal health business in the form of Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS) .|What Merck would getMerck, which has underperformed peers like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in 2013, could really use some dealmaking to boost its business efficiency in support of its upcoming pipeline of drugs. That pipeline includes exciting potential growth drivers like a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's Disease and a PD-1 inhibitor for various cancers that has received FDA Breakthrough Designation.|Merck has already sought to improve operating efficiency with layoffs and the sale of its ingredient-manufacturing business. Dropping its consumer care business would remove a segment whose sales declined 3% year over year in the first nine months of 2013. It would also pick up Novartis' animal health business to supplement its own stagnant business -- but that's not that exciting.|Merck's next potential move could be far more interesting. Merck could package up its own animal health business with Novartis's, cut out inefficiencies and emphasize synergies, and spin off the business to uncover its value. At a trailing P/EBITDA of 9.4, Merck could unlock as much as 50% in extra value if the reshaped business were comparable to Zoetis, which trades at a P/EBITDA of 13.5. That cashflow could offset waning sales of blockbuster Januvia and bolster its research efforts.|What Zoetis would getAlmost all of Zoetis' competitors are veterinary subsidiaries of larger pharmaceutical businesses. As the largest of the animal-health pure plays, Zoetis is in a prime position to profit in a global market for animal health care. But with seemingly every big pharma player looking to slice and dice corporate structures, there's always a risk that another pure play competitor will appear out of the blue. If rumors of a Novartis-Merck asset swap are true, Zoetis could face the challenge of competing with a new, reinvigorated animal health business.|The bottom lineThe word "restructuring" can have positive and negative connotations. On one hand, it could mean that management is seeking answers for a struggling business. On the other hand, it could mean that management is optimistic about the core business and sees an opportunity to unlock the value of a secondary component to the business. Fellow Fool Leo Sun points out that that was the motivating factor behind Zoetis' spinoff. Selling or trading animal-health and consumer-care divisions could benefit Novartis, Merck, and their shareholders, but only if the companies can use those proceeds to execute their core pharmaceutical pipelines.

EdgeCast is a content delivery network, or CDN, provider that sells its services to companies like Twitter, Pinterest, and Hulu, and it competes with companies like Akamai (NASDAQ: AKAM) and Level 3 (NYSE: LVLT) . Verizon's acquisition of the network could have a significant impact on the CDN provider market.|What will Verizon do with EdgeCast?In short, nothing. EdgeCast will simply replace Verizon's home-baked CDN and become part of Verizon's Digital Media Services, or VDMS, group. EdgeCast ought to continue operating as usual.|What Verizon will likely do with EdgeCast is provide a strong financial backing for a profitable business. One of the biggest challenges for CDNs is increasing R&D expenditure as its often limited by revenue growth. And although revenue growth at Akamai, Level 3, and other CDNs has been strong in the past, analysts expect that growth to slow in the future. That trend is already visible in longtime CDN expert Limelight Networks.|Verizon ought to give a strong boost to EdgeCast's efforts to scale its network, which should support revenue growth for the company. In other words, competing CDNs could see Verizon capture market share with EdgeCast by outspending them.|The whole packageThe EdgeCast acquisition comes just a few weeks after Verizon bought digital media streaming company UpLynk. The two acquisitions coupled with Verizon's position in video services with FiOS TV give Verizon a complete video ecosystem.|Verizon has content partnerships through its FiOS segment, transcoding technology necessary for playback on any device, content delivery through EdgeCast, and with UpLynk a front-end management software solution. Verizon could market this package to broadcasters as an alternative to Level 3's ecosystem, which has had great success marketing its all-in-one solution.|Verizon could potentially undercut Level 3's pricing. Verizon has multiple revenue streams to support lower margins at EdgeCast, but moreover should be able to reduce EdgeCast's costs. This will allow Verizon, if it's so inclined, to reduce the price of its CDN services in order to gain market share.|Bad news for AkamaiAside from potential pricing pressure, this is especially bad news for Akamai. Verizon is a big reseller of Akamai's services, and with this EdgeCast acquisition it's likely that partnership will come to an end.|Additionally, Akamai has been trying to improve its position with wireless carriers. EdgeCast already has a huge lead in the market, as it's been the company's main focus since its inception. With the acquisition by Verizon, it should only strengthen its position as the go to CDN service for telecom companies.|This could also impact Akamai's business with media companies should Verizon begin providing a package like Level 3. Akamai doesn't have the same framework to build a complete ecosystem like Verizon, and it doesn't have the cash to put the pieces together quickly. Granted, Akamai has held its own in the video delivery market, but a lot of growth has come from the expansion of the video streaming market as a whole.|Akamai may be hard-pressed to continue growing its video delivery business with Verizon now in the fold and Netflix becoming more self-reliant. Aside from a more complete service, Verizon could offer better pricing in a market that already has tremendous downward pressure on pricing.|Big names moving inVerizon is just one of several large companies that are getting serious about CDN services. Netflix, as mentioned, is another one, and Amazon continues to improve its CloudFront service.|Still, Akamai is the leader in the industry, and has a lot of strong competencies that these companies can't or don't match ... yet. Level 3, likewise, has a very strong video delivery platform, and could still benefit from the continued growth of video streaming. In the long run, however, I see Verizon and other larger companies materially impacting the industry as a whole.

Even though peers Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Deere (NYSE: DE) are also suffering from poor conditions in the industry, Joy Global's focus on mining puts it squarely in the path of devastation that plunging commodities prices have had on the miners that buy the company's equipment.|As recently as last year, Joy Global's business focus seemed like a smart move, as Caterpillar struggled from its exposure to the general construction equipment business even as mining continued to thrive. But falling prices for precious metals like gold and silver as well as base metals and mined products like coal caused big problems for mining-equipment sales, and Joy Global has seen its results plunge since early this year. Will this quarter give Joy Global a turnaround opportunity? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Joy Global over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.

Global economic uncertainties have compelled several integrated majors, including BP (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-B) , to scrap projects and reduce their spending plans for next year. On the other hand, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has no such frugality in mind as we near 2014. Chevron's spending plans remain firmly in place, and management believes they will put the company in an advantageous position over the long term. Here's why Chevron is on the right track.|Why continued spending is an advantageChevron makes no apologies for its capital expenditure levels, which some analysts see as bloated. For example, Chevron is in the middle of a massive $6.4 billion natural gas project in China. Chevron's efforts in China represent one of its largest capital projects for this year and beyond, and for good reason. China is the world's fourth-largest gas consumer. The total potential of this project is considerable. Chevron secured a 30-year deal to produce 7.6 billion cubic meters of gas per year, and the project should come on-line in the latter part of 2014.|In all, Chevron intends to allocate between $33 billion and $36 billion to capital expenditures next year. Chevron's 2013 spending is already on pace to eclipse the $33 billion projected earlier this year, due to significant land acquisitions. Moreover, the company can't guarantee that its capital expenditures will not increase even further, should the company find new, compelling projects.|Competitors rein it inChevron's competitors take a different view of future expenditures. To deal with the likelihood of billions more in penalties resulting from its ongoing civil trial, BP has capped its spending plans for the foreseeable future. The company advises investors it will keep capital expenditures between $24 billion and $27 billion per year through the end of the decade.|BP and Royal Dutch Shell provide 5% dividend yields, which are far ahead of Chevron's 3.3% yield. However, Chevron's future looks better, thanks to its continued commitment to investment. While BP and Royal Dutch Shell focus on shedding assets to raise cash, Chevron will proceed, full steam ahead, with projects it considers vital for growth. As a result, Chevron's investors should feel extremely confident about its future.

Over the past decade, the company has increased its dividend at a 10.6% compounded annual rate. If you had bought and held the stock over that time, the yield on your original investment would be 11.5% today.|Take a look at the chart below to see what I mean. This example assumes you purchased 100 Chevron shares at around $34 near the beginning of 2003.|Let's continue this thought experiment for another decade. Assuming that Chevron can continue to grow its dividend at a 10% compounded annual rate, by 2023 our yield on cost would be 30%!|But it gets even better. Over the previous 10 years, Chevron also repurchased 10% of its outstanding shares. This increases our stake in a wonderful business and is something we can expect to continue in the upcoming decade.|But can Chevron realistically maintain this growth rate? Actually, it's not really a crazy assumption. Many of the company's big investments, such as the Alberta oil sands, are just beginning to bear fruit. Chevron estimates that total production will grow 27% by 2017.This should generate plenty of cash flow for additional dividend hikes and share buybacks.|Chevron is evidence that when it comes to income investing, dividend growth is far more important than a big yield.

Big Oil appears ready to handle whatever happens on the legal front between Repsol and the Argentinean government. The exploitation of the Vaca Muerta Basin will demand capital and technology, and Argentina now lacks both. I wasn't surprised when Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and YPF signed a memorandum of understanding in late 2012 to explore both conventional and unconventional shale gas and oil.|Chevron moved forward in July 2013 when it signed a deal with YPF to invest $1.24 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale. In August 2013, the Chevron-YPF venture received final approval from Argentina's province of Neuquen. Based on this deal, the venture will drill 115 wells expecting an output of 11 million barrels of oil in the first year. After the first stage ends, Chevron will have an option to continue the accord (which encompasses as much as $16 billion in spending) until 2048. From the second to 35th year, the venture would drill 1,562 wells to produce 782 million barrels at a rate of 23.7 million of barrels a year.|This is a relatively low-risk investment for Chevron, which knows that YPF has already found both a massive deposit of natural gas that is equivalent to a quarter of Argentina's proven reserves in Vaca Muerta, and an oil deposit of 927 million barrels that represents Argentina's oil consumption for two years. Both discoveries also bode well for Transportadora's business because they are in close proximity to the company's existing lines.|However, Chevron isn't alone. ExxonMobil, which is already exploring for unconventional oil and gas with YPF in Argentina, announced last summer that it plans to invest $250 million to explore the Vaca Muerta shale.

As such, investors must be starting to wonder what exactly it's going to take for the stock to break out of its range.|Moreover, if the naysayers are right, buying Home Depot or other housing-related stocks like Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) , Masco (NYSE: MAS) , Williams-Sonoma (NYSE: WSM) or Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) could prove a costly error made at the peak of optimism over the housing market.|The bear caseA pessimistic outlook sees the housing market as stalling at the altar of higher interest rates.

CenturyLink is only using 49% of its operating income on interest, while Verizon uses just 7.8% of its operating income on interest payments.

By comparison, CenturyLink reported a decline of 3% using this same measure, while Verizon increased its cash flow by 13%. It's really no surprise that Frontier's cash flow is declining considering that the company's revenue is down.|Connected to this cash flow decline, Frontier's core free cash flow payout is troublesome.

CenturyLink uses 51% of its free cash flow on dividends, while Verizon uses just 27%. Since Frontier pays a yield of more than 8%, investors should keep a close eye on these numbers to determine if this dividend is safe.|The core problem for investors is that Frontier appears to be in a weaker position than its peers. With revenue and cash flow down, the company must turn these numbers around. Given that the company's cash flow payout ratio is already higher than their peers, investors shouldn't count on this high yield. CenturyLink and Verizon may have lower yields, but their payouts seem better protected.

EdgeCast has more than 6,000 customers and is consistently profitable, although the dilemma for Verizon will be that some of those customers are current competitors to Verizon.|Akamai (NASDAQ: AKAM) shares dropped more than 1% today on the news, as Verizon has long been a reseller and customer of Akamai's own CDN services. With the deal, Verizon could potentially shift its attention to its own newly acquired offerings. CDN services have become commoditized in recent years, with players losing pricing power. Akamai certainly can't be pleased to see one of its prominent partners scooping up one of its competitors.

But Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) marches to a different drummer. Verizon shares dipped as much as 1.3% over the weekend, making it the second-worst Dow performer today.|So what's wrong with Verizon today, when most of its Dow peers are sailing on smooth market waters?|Well, Verizon just announced that it's buying digital content delivery specialist EdgeCast, leaving investors to wonder if Verizon will get what it paid for -- or less -- from the deal.|Verizon didn't disclose exactly how much it's paying for the privately held media streaming service, but respected industry observer Dan Rayburn estimates the deal at "close to $400 million."|With more than $24 billion of intangible goodwill assets on its balance sheet, Verizon is no stranger to the buyout game. Still, Rayburn's estimate would make this one of Verizon's largest acquisitions in recent years, and the biggest bet so far on the teeming content delivery market.|Content delivery services aren't exactly news to Verizon, but the telecom giant has preferred to resell Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM) services to cover its data customers' CDN needs. Akamai shares plunged 2% on the news that Verizon is taking a direct rival in-house, removing one of Akamai's most important channel partners.|Verizon investors aren't sure that there's any real value in the content delivery market. Akamai has nearly doubled its sales over the last five years, which shows why Verizon might be interested in EdgeCast as a growth driver. On the other hand, smaller content delivery expert Limelight Networks (NASDAQ: LLNW) has jumped off the revenue growth gravy train. Content delivery is not a guaranteed success, and Verizon might fail to follow Akamai's example.|This deal also flies in the face of recent content delivery trends. In particular, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has built its own content delivery system, cutting its ties to both Akamai and Limelight along the way. If the largest content wrangler on the entire Internet can roll its own CDN, then what's stopping other large content distributors from following the same template? On that note, Verizon just might be buying into a dead-end strategy here.|All valid concerns, but I think that the timing of the EdgeCast deal underscores how much value Verizon sees in content delivery. Remember, Verizon is in the middle of a $130 billion agreement to take over the remaining 45% of Verizon Wireless from longtime partner Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) . That deal involves a fresh $49 billion bond and doesn't leave Verizon with a lot of financial wiggle room.|But Verizon still sees enough value in content delivery to spend nearly half a billion dollars on EdgeCast, even with the Vodafone deal putting fiscal pressure on Big Red's wallet.|All things considered, EdgeCast won't make or break Verizon's business. I think investors overreacted to the potential risks in the EdgeCast deal. You can take this modest price drop as a gentle buy-in opportunity -- if you were already looking at Verizon as a potential buy.|If not, then nothing much has changed.

Over the entire five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday -- what ChannelAdvisor is calling the "Cyber 5" -- its e-commerce website recorded more than one billion page views. Cyber Monday is becoming a week-long shopping extravaganza now, which is why Wal-Mart's Sam's Club division extended all its holiday promotions through Dec. 8.|Major retailers are in panic mode this year. A soft economic environment, wary consumers, and a shortened holiday shopping season are conspiring to put a lump of coal in their Christmas stockings. As a result, Wal-Mart began promoting its Black Friday sales a week early, department stores from Macy's to J.C. Penney opened on Thanksgiving Day itself, and as we're seeing with Sam's Club, many extended their sale prices all week long, making it difficult to lure shoppers away from those deep discounts.|It's indicative of how the rise of big box stores is killing smaller merchants. Home Depot and Lowe's have all but driven away the local hardware store, while the corner grocery store finds it difficult to compete against the likes of Wal-Mart and Target. Still, I've come around to the notion of supporting small farmers by buying locally grown produce when possible, so extending that to help bolster the business chances of my neighborhood retailer wasn't that much of a stretch.

Wal-Mart struggled earlier this year as federal cost cuts furloughed IRS workers, leading to delayed tax refunds for numerous Americans. These refund checks are normally a strong driver of sales in Wal-Mart's second quarter that simply weren't there this time around.|Ultimately, though, it's a sheer case of size and Wal-Mart has the pricing edge over just about any of its competitors. Wal-Mart's diverse product offerings and size enable it to undercut most local stores in price and drive loyalty through steep discounting. Also, because of its size, it's able to negotiate larger-than-average product purchases at favorable rates that keep its costs down relative to smaller chain and local stores.|Wal-Mart is the type of company that could be perfectly set up to drive customer traffic once quantitative easing ends. The potential for higher lending rates could negatively impact credit card holders and drive even more cost-conscious consumers through Wal-Mart's doors. You're certainly not going to find double-digit growth rates here, but it's a business model that can withstand a robust or recessionary economy, and therefore it's not the best shorting opportunity.|Foolish roundupThis week's theme is really all about a company's ability to exert pricing power and/or control. Wal-Mart's size enables it to dictate prices that will drive consumer traffic and command discounts for large purchase orders. Arch and Molycorp, by contrast, have far lesser pricing power. Arch is doing its best to improve that through exports, but Molycorp is really going to struggle as it brings its new mine up to speed and introduces new rare-earth products into an already overcrowded market.

Yet with competition remaining fierce against Target (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as well as other major retailers both with physical stores and online commerce, Costco can't afford to slow down if it wants to keep earnings moving higher.|The warehouse retailer's secret to success has been its innovative membership model, in which customers pay for the privilege to shop in Costco stores. With a reliable stream of recurring revenue from membership fees, Costco can afford to offer products at lower prices than retailers without that revenue stream, giving it a key competitive edge. But as Wal-Mart, Target, and other rivals get savvier about the business, will they find an answer that makes Costco look obsolete? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Costco Wholesale over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Costco actually disappointed investors with its report for the quarter ended in August, with a rare miss on the earnings front. Sales rose only 1%, although comparable-store sales jumped 5% due to a big increase in customer traffic, considerably outpacing comps at Target and Wal-Mart. A 3% jump in membership fees to $716 million represented a huge portion of Costco's overall operating profit, and renewal rates continued to climb from their already-impressive levels. The report turned out to be a nonevent in terms of share-price movement.|Yet one way that Costco tried to enhance its positive reputation involved not maximizing sales. Unlike Target and Wal-Mart, Costco decided not to open its doors on Thanksgiving Day, in just another sign of its dedication to its employees. With the controversy over low-income work and the minimum wage in recent months, Costco's attention to its employee base seems prescient in giving it another competitive advantage over its rivals. Moreover, the move is just one more sign of the flexibility that Costco's membership model gives the retailer that Wal-Mart and Target can't afford.|In the Costco earnings report, look most closely at membership renewal rates. As long as people keep ponying up for annual membership, they're going to keep shopping at Costco. And as long as that happens, Costco will keep a key advantage over Target and Wal-Mart.

A hearing on the proposed settlement is set for early next year.|Wal-Mart tells NBC News it's been named as a defendant in 24 of the lawsuits.|Those lawsuits allege that Blitz and Wal-Mart knowingly sold a defective product that could explode and produce catastrophic and sometimes fatal injuries, and refused to add a safety device, known as a flame arrester, to make the cans safer.|In depositions, Wal-Mart officials insisted that the manufacturer -- not Wal-Mart -- was responsible for the safety of the product. A former gas can buyer for Wal-Mart, Jacques DesHommes, said when questioned in 2010 for a lawsuit that even after being sued over alleged gas can explosions, the company did not conduct any tests or investigate whether explosions were actually occurring.|"Wal-Mart does not test the can, the products.

The company did so.|Wal-Mart officials acknowledged that Blitz asked Wal-Mart to support such a campaign. The officials told NBC News that Wal-Mart did not agree to help with the campaign, but did not explain why.|An internal corporate video from a company meeting in 2003, posted on YouTube by a communications company, shows a Wal-Mart official making a joke about a gas can exploding.|In the video, a Wal-Mart employee wearing a helmet and sunglasses, drives what appears to be a motorized scooter down a store aisle and into a display of the red portable plastic gas cans, marked with a sign that reads "2 for $9.00." A chorus of shouted "whoas!" can be heard in the background as some of the cans fall to the ground.|Buchanan told NBC News that the video was made two years before the first lawsuit involving a Blitz can that named Wal-Mart as a defendant. She later confirmed that a lawsuit involving an alleged gas can explosion in the 1990s had named Wal-Mart as a defendant. That lawsuit involved a different manufacturer, Rubbermaid, which no longer makes plastic gas cans, Buchanan said.|Asked why Wal-Mart did not ask Blitz USA to add flame arresters after it became aware of allegations in the lawsuits that the absence of a flame arrester had contributed to those incidents, Buchanan said, "Wal-Mart is a retailer, we rely on the experts."

As part of a way to lower cost per available seat mile, or CASM, Air Canada has configured the 777 aircraft in a high-density 458-seat layout for total seating capacity approaching that of the larger Boeing 747-800 jet.|But planned purchases from Boeing don't end there. Beginning in the spring of 2014, Air Canada will begin taking deliveries for the first of its 37 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft on order. These aircraft will gradually move in to phase out many of the less efficient Boeing 767 aircraft in mainline Air Canada's fleet. But the 767 aircraft will find a second life in the fleet of Air Canada's low-cost subsidiary, Air Canada Rouge, where the transfer of 767 aircraft will dramatically grow the Rouge fleet over the next several years.|More buysDespite these previous purchases, Air Canada isn't finished acquiring new aircraft. Reports are suggesting that the Canadian flag carrier is on the verge of placing an order for up to 60 new jets. The Globe and Mail notes that this purchase could determine the winner in the tight aircraft order race between Boeing and Airbus, a subsidiary of European Aeronautic Defense and Space (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) .|More big ordersAfter a year of strong sales at most aerospace manufacturers, Air Canada may well settle the results of the annual order race between Boeing and Airbus. Additionally, an order for either Embraer or Bombardier aircraft may not be far off as Air Canada seeks to modernize its fleet.

The thought among pessimists had been that Congress' inability to come up with a bipartisan budget would trigger spending cuts that would hurt the defense sector the most and affect Boeing's bottom-line results. What we've seen is the opposite with a new contract announcement rolling in practically every month. In return, what few short-sellers there are here have likely been squeezed out of their positions as Boeing flies higher.|Following Boeing's astronomically strong year, I definitely think some skepticism is warranted. The potential for a labor union strike always concerns me and it's quite clear that even with Boeing's staggered revenue for its contracts that it could struggle over the next couple of years as the U.S. government reins in its overzealous defense spending. Boeing is a company I like with a low double-digit P/E. At 18 times forward earnings, we're getting into rarefied air for a company that will historically only grow organically by mid-single-digits.|In similar fashion to Boeing, United Technologies has been a big beneficiary of a more subtle drop in government spending than expected. The diversified aerospace and industrials company also got a boost from the end of the 16-day government shutdown in early October, which appears to have affected the economy in a much smaller way than initially expected. Having generated more than $6 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12-months and yielding 2.1%, United Technologies simply doesn't offer short-sellers the immediate downside catalysts that they're often seeking.|Also, like Boeing, I'm a bit concerned about how reduced government spending over the coming two to three years could impact United Technologies' top-line growth. I'm not too concerned about United Technologies being able to grow earnings as there are ample cost-cutting opportunities afforded to it, as well as the opportunity to repurchase its own shares -- but a lack of top-line growth would be worrisome. For now United Technologies looks on track with revenue growth of 5% expected in fiscal 2014, but I'd keep a close eye on domestic orders as that'll drive investor sentiment over the coming years.

First, Chevron is a dividend aristocrat, having raised its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years, and short-sellers tend to avoid companies that pay a high yield as it often signifies a healthy company with few downside catalysts. Another factor is that Chevron's business is diversified. When oil prices drop and its exploration and production business feel the pain, the company's refineries step up and pick up the slack. When oil prices are soaring, we often see the opposite effect. Finally, oil is a finite quantity product so there's a psychological floor on pricing which helps maintain strong cash flow for Chevron.|This question really depends on your investing timeframe. If you're only looking out over the next six months or less, Chevron has a lot of questions marks to contend with including its delayed $6.4 billion gas project in China with PetroChina as well as numerous other assets that have proved too expensive to build-out, such as its Rosebank development in the North Sea, or where protests made exploration not viable such as in Romania. These question marks could all negatively impact Chevron over the near-term, but Chevron's strategic diversity should allow it to handily outperform over the long run.

That's especially true in the energy world, where integrated behemoths like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) simultaneously operate several different businesses across the upstream, midstream, and downstream spectrum. This has pronounced benefits, including lower volatility of overall results, since one segment's suffering is commonly offset by another's strength.|At the same time, an oil major splitting up may unlock value for shareholders. That was the mentality behind ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) spinning off its refining and midstream businesses, and it's worked out very well. ExxonMobil's shares have underperformed both the overall market and many of its closest competitors this year, which begs the question: Would shareholders benefit from a break-up?|Are the parts worth more than the whole?That's got to be the key question if ExxonMobil were to ponder a break-up. It's a consideration that merits discussion, especially considering the success ConocoPhillips had in its own spinoffs. You'll recall that ConocoPhillips spun off its refining unit, Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) , last year. Phillips 66 even went a step further, spinning off its own midstream assets into master limited partnership Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE: PSXP) .|Its units had an IPO price of $23 and quickly surged 30% to nearly $30 per unit on the first day of trading. As a result, there's precedent that indicates ExxonMobil's separate businesses may be worth more than the sum of the parts.|The risk of going it aloneOf course, the flip side of this argument deserves attention. The risk of underperformance of one or more of its individual segments is a very real concern. The integrated model ExxonMobil currently employs allows for inherently less volatility of its underlying results.|As previously mentioned, the poor environment for refining has severely affected most refiners, including Phillips 66. ExxonMobil's own refining unit is performing poorly as well, which is overshadowing relatively strong performance in other areas of its business. Consider that ExxonMobil's earnings fell 18% in the third quarter and are down 31% year to date, due almost entirely to its refining difficulties.|As a result, should ExxonMobil spin off its refining (or other) segments, investors in those particular units would be more vulnerable should business conditions worsen. However, investors may appreciate having the option to pick and choose which businesses they'd like to invest in. ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and Phillips 66 Partners each currently enjoy rising share prices while ExxonMobil has underperformed the market this year.|Should ExxonMobil follow a similar path as ConocoPhillips, it's true that each individual business would no longer enjoy the relative comfort of being under one big umbrella. On their own, specific businesses are clearly more susceptible to the troubles of their respective industries. That hasn't had a pronounced negative effect on ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, or Phillips 66 Partners to this point.

Although relatively small in size, the two companies' brand lineups are robust. As such, Church & Dwight and Prestige Brands represent two of the most well-rounded investments in the space.|Strong brand recognitionSimilar to what Johnson & Johnson has done over the years, both Church and Dwight and Prestige Brands have acquired and subsequently strengthened valuable brands over time. Here is a look at all three companies' popular brand lineups:|Johnson & Johnson|While Johnson & Johnson clearly has the most robust stable of brands with popular brands like Band-Aid, Rogaine and Motrin were left out; it is impressive that both Church & Dwight and Prestige Brands have brands that are relatively comparable to some products in the Johnson & Johnson lineup.|Solid growthStrong brand names have contributed significantly to the growth of both companies. The following is a breakdown of the projected 2014 growth rates of Church & Dwight and Prestige Brands alongside those of Johnson & Johnson:|Johnson & Johnson|When we take into account the companies' valuation levels, all three appear fairly valued in relative terms. However, Church & Dwight is the most expensive with a forward P/E of 21.2 and Johnson & Johnson is the cheapest with a forward P/E of 16.04. Prestige Brands falls squarely in the middle with a forward P/E of 19.08.|DividendsJohnson & Johnson leads both competitors in terms of dividend yield. The consumer goods giant currently pays an annual dividend of $2.64, equal to a yield of 2.8%. Church & Dwight's annual dividend of $1.12 is equal to a respectable yield of 1.7%.|However, what Church & Dwight lacks in yield it more than makes up for in dividend growth. The company has been just as consistent as Johnson & Johnson with regard to raising its dividend at consistent intervals. Both companies have increased their dividends each year for the last decade.|Where Church & Dwight leads Johnson & Johnson is in the rate at which it increases its dividend. Over the last ten years, the company has achieved an annual dividend growth rate of over 25%, which is significantly better than Johnson & Johnson's 11.8% growth rate in the same time period.|ConclusionIt is clear that large size is not a prerequisite for success in the consumer goods segment. While not better in all aspects, both Church & Dwight and Prestige Brands are still viable investment alternatives to consumer goods stalwarts like Johnson & Johnson.|Church & Dwight offers the most growth out of the group but trades at more expensive valuation multiples as a result. Prestige Brands falls short in the dividend category but manages to make up for it with solid earnings growth and cheaper valuation. Since they are still relatively small, both companies should remain quality long-term holdings and viable growth alternatives to Johnson & Johnson in the consumer goods space.

Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, for instance, offers dozens of consumer products for sale, many of which are inelastic in that they sell in both booming and miserable economic environments (if you think about it, you need laundry detergent and toothpaste no matter what!). What this means for Procter & Gamble is that it always maintains strong pricing power which keeps its cash flow relatively steady, leading to few quarterly earnings surprises.|Unless the U.S. economy falls off a cliff, P&G might be one of the safest names out there. You will certainly give up some growth potential as an investor in Procter & Gamble as it's saturated many industrialized nations around the globe; however it does offer incredible growth potential in emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia. With a dividend that's grown in size for 56 straight years, I'd probably suggest short-sellers look elsewhere for ideas.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/08/3-things-to-consider-before-investing-in-coca-cola.aspx|12/08/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|0|3 Things to Consider Before Investing in Coca-Cola Hellenic|Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) second largest bottler, Coca-Cola Hellenic (NYSE: CCH) , largely serves Eastern Europe, Ireland, and Nigeria . Depressed macroeconomic conditions and political volatility in many of Coca-Cola Hellenic's operating regions led to an overall sales and volume decline of 5% and 3%, respectively, during the most recent quarter. Before investing in this company, there are three things to consider.|Europeans like trademark Coca-ColaEuropean popularity of trademark Coca-Cola brands served as a buffer against further declines in Coca-Cola Hellenic's top line, with a 3% volume increase in trademark Coca-Cola products in the most recent quarter. Coca-Cola Zero, a low-calorie product, grew volume an amazing 18% according to the last earnings call. Interestingly, Coca-Cola's bottler in Western Europe, Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) , also reported a 4% increase in sparkling beverages driven largely by a 23% increase in Coca-Cola Zero. Moreover, flavored Coca-Cola products such as Vanilla Coke and Coca-Cola Cherry Zero increased volume "almost 10%". Based on these figures, it's reasonable to conclude that the Coca-Cola brand still holds considerable weight in certain parts of the world regardless of health concerns.|Tough economic and political environmentsAusterity measures in places like Greece and political instability in places like the Ukraine laid the foundation for high unemployment and subsequent low consumer confidence in Eastern Europe. Greece stands as an extreme example of economic depression, with unemployment clocking in at 28%, the highest level in the European Union. Coca-Cola Helenic's volume in Greece declined in the "high-single digits". However, even in that country, sparkling beverages showed resiliency. The emerging markets segment showed a 4% volume decline due to weak performances in Romania, Ukraine, and Serbia. Currently, it doesn't look any better in the Ukraine, as the president's refusal to enter the European Union has resulted in social unrest.|Non-sparkling beverages underperformingAlso a European phenomenon, Coca-Cola Hellenic's non-sparkling beverages struggled in the most recent quarter. Ready-to-drink teas and water declined 11% and 10%, respectively. Coca-Cola Enterprises also struggled, with still beverages declining 5% overall. Frugal customers all over Europe probably want to shy away from paying a premium for commoditized beverages. In the case of water, consumers probably prefer to get it for free from the tap or other sources to save their consumer dollars for the occasional Coke or Fanta.|Foolish takeawayCoca-Cola Hellenic seems fraught with political risk due to its operating territory. In addition, its market risk resides in the high range, as it trades within 10% of its 52-week high with a P/E ratio of 48. For comparison, the S&P 500 trades at 20. On the bright side, if you like risk, Coca-Cola Hellenic sits on one of Coca-Cola's frontiers where per capita consumption remains at its lowest. You may want to consider Coca-Cola Enterprises as a better bottler play due to its operation in the more politically stable Western European region where it also shows signs of economic recovery. Coca-Cola Enterprises also sports a lower P/E ratio of 19.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/08/the-1-way-amazoncom-is-catching-wal-mart.aspx|12/08/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|1|The 1 Way Amazon.com Is Catching Wal-Mart|For the last decade or more, the promise of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) for investors has been its potential to one day rival Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) as a global mass retailer. For those who got in anywhere near the ground floor, it was a great bet.|Whereas Wal-Mart's market capitalization has oscillated between $175 billion and $250 billion for most of the past 10 years, Amazon's market cap did not exceed $50 billion until late 2009, and was still below $100 billion at the beginning of last year.|Today, Amazon.com is much closer to catching Wal-Mart in terms of market cap. As of Friday morning, Amazon's market cap was $177 billion, roughly two-thirds of Wal-Mart's value. Yet in terms of revenue and profit, Amazon is still way behind. While I'm no fan of Wal-Mart stock, Amazon seems even less appealing today now that it's valued at nearly the same amount as Wal-Mart.|Watch the gapAmazon.com is growing quickly, but it still has a long way to go to catch Wal-Mart. Last year, Wal-Mart generated revenue of $469 billion, more than seven times higher than Amazon's revenue of $61 billion. For next year, analysts expect Wal-Mart's revenue to reach $496 billion, while Amazon's will grow to $91.5 billion.|On a raw numbers basis, Amazon is not gaining ground very quickly. While 2013 is on track to be the first year in which Amazon actually adds more revenue than Wal-Mart, the company is expected to close the revenue gap by just $3.5 billion between 2013 and 2014 combined.|Looking at profitability, the gulf between Wal-Mart and Amazon is even wider. In each of the last three years, Wal-Mart has earned net income between $15 billion and $17 billion. By contrast, in 2010 -- its most profitable year ever -- Amazon earned net income of just $1.15 billion. Analysts currently expect Amazon's earnings to return to the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range next year following a three-year period of reduced earnings.|It's nice to have cash nowThe bull case for Amazon.com rests upon the idea that it can continue growing revenue quickly for many more years, and that this will eventually lead to a higher profit margin. However, even if Amazon sustains a long-term double-digit revenue growth rate -- which would be challenging -- it will still take 15 to 20 years to reach Wal-Mart's current size. It will be even harder to reach parity with Wal-Mart (since Wal-Mart is likely to continue making gradual revenue gains).|As I have argued previously, Amazon.com is no more efficient than competitors like Wal-Mart. While it saves money by not operating stores, Amazon has to pay to run busy warehouses, and to ship goods directly to customers. Increasingly, it is also using services like Prime Instant Video as loss leaders to attract customers to the Amazon ecosystem. As a result, Amazon's long-term margins are likely to be fairly similar to Wal-Mart's.|Even if Amazon can eventually catch -- or even exceed -- Wal-Mart in terms of earnings, that doesn't mean that the company is worth as much as Wal-Mart today. While Amazon is busy reinvesting all of its meager profits to produce growth, Wal-Mart is generating a flood of cash that it can return to shareholders.|Wal-Mart currently pays more than $6 billion in dividends annually! Based on Wal-Mart's history of consistent dividend increases, it is likely to pay well over $100 billion in dividends before Amazon starts to rival it in terms of earnings (if that ever occurs). Wal-Mart is also buying back stock to gradually reduce its share count, whereas Amazon's share count has been increasing steadily.|Foolish bottom lineIt's true that Amazon.com's dominance of e-commerce could make it the next Wal-Mart. Just five years ago, that was a great reason to invest in Amazon, as it could be bought for a fraction of the price of Wal-Mart.|Today, the situation is much different. Amazon is still worth slightly less than Wal-Mart, but the discount is pretty minimal considering that Wal-Mart is sending lots of cash back to shareholders, while Amazon needs to invest heavily to keep growing quickly. Unless you think that Amazon has a nearly infinite ceiling -- that it can one day be a multitrillion-dollar business -- Amazon stock does not look appetizing at all.|Dividends can help you build wealthAmazon.com may have growth on its side, but Wal-Mart's dividends are a tantalizing reward for investors.

However, analysts expected sales of $116.8 billion. Comparable-store sales in the U.S. decreased 0.3% as fewer customers flocked to Wal-Mart stores. This was mainly because customers restricted their spending as they are trying to save every penny that they can.|Although Costco witnessed higher customer traffic, an increase in costs led to a lower than expected bottom line in its recently reported quarter. Wal-Mart has been facing stiff competition from Costco in the warehouse segment. Moreover, Costco plans to expand its presence in Mexico by adding new stores and launching a Mexican e-commerce website. Wal-Mart also has a strong presence in Mexico.|Another factor which played a key role in Wal-Mart's underperformance was the closure of 50 stores in Brazil and China, which reduced revenue from the retailer's international segment. However, the retailer plans to add 100 stores in China in the years to come.|Endless challengesWal-Mart has a number of challenges which need to be overcome. Apart from macroeconomic factors such as low consumer demand, the retailer has to fight stiff competition from other players.|One of the challenges for Wal-Mart has been show-rooming. The emergence of online retailers such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) , which delivers products at lower prices with the click of a mouse, has affected Wal-Mart's sales. Customers simply try on clothes in Wal-Mart stores and then buy them online from Amazon. Although Wal-Mart has expanded its e-commerce business significantly, it cannot compete on price with Amazon since the latter has no store-related costs. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding AmazonFresh, which will compete with Wal-Mart's grocery delivery business.|Wal-Mart has been trying to provide the lowest possible prices in order to attract the maximum number of customers, and it plans further price cuts. However, this will affect its margins as well as its bottom line. This justifies the lowered outlook that Wal-Mart provided with its quarterly results. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings between $5.11-$5.21 per share for the fiscal year, versus the range of $5.10-$5.30 per share it provided earlier.|The takeawayWal-Mart has not been able to live up to investors' expectations. Its disheartening results were accompanied by a dull outlook, leading to a drop in its stock price. Moreover, it has been witnessing declining store traffic, lower comps, and increased competition in all of its segments. Thus, a prudent investor should stay away from this company.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/07/5-reasons-big-red-is-a-big-buy.aspx|12/07/2013|0|"AT&T"|1|Start with the obviousVerizon looks like a buy because of the company's relatively strong revenue growth. Most investors don't get excited about annual revenue growth better than 4%. However, in the telecom business, this result from Verizon was particularly strong. In the same time frame, AT&T (NYSE: T) grew revenue by just over 2% and CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL) reported a revenue decline of roughly 1%.|The second reason investors should consider buying Verizon is the fact that the company's top-line growth led to EPS growth as well. With adjusted EPS up more than 20%, it's like Verizon is operating in a different industry than the other two companies. While AT&T increased EPS annually by more than 6%, CenturyLink saw a decline of almost 8%.|A third vote of confidence for the stock: Analysts expect Verizon to continue beating its competition in terms of future earnings growth. In the next five years, the average analyst expects better than 10% annual EPS growth. Since AT&T is expected to grow earnings by just over 6%, and CenturyLink's growth is pegged at just over 1%, it seems clear that Verizon will continue crushing the competition in the next few years.|The fourth reason to buy Verizon is the company generated $0.18 of core free cash flow from each dollar of sales. By comparison, CenturyLink managed $0.14 during this same timeframe, while AT&T produced $0.10. With such a dominant performance, it's hard to argue that Verizon is a compelling stock to buy.|The final argument for Verizon's stock: Looking at core operating cash flow (net income plus depreciation), Verizon reported a 13% annual increase over the last nine months. To say this was a dominant performance is an understatement, as AT&T only increased its cash flow by about 2%, and CenturyLink witnessed a decline of 3%.|Combining growing operating cash flow and strong free cash flow generation results in a relatively low free cash flow payout ratio. Over the last nine months, Verizon used just over 27% of its core free cash flow on dividend payments. Considering that CenturyLink used 51% of its free cash flow, and AT&T used more than 75%, the case to buy Verizon looks even stronger.|Buy Big Red to generate big greenNo matter how you look at it, Verizon is doing better than its peers. Though the company's yield is just over 4%, compared to 5% at AT&T and CenturyLink at about 7%, this yield will almost certainly climb.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/07/will-atts-new-plan-crush-apples-iphone-business.aspx|12/07/2013|0|"AT&T"|0|Will AT&T's New Plan Crush Apple's iPhone Business?|Perhaps fearing the rapid, recent growth of T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) , AT&T (NYSE: T) has unveiled a new plan that could lead to the carrier selling fewer of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones. Starting next week, AT&T subscribers will have the option of signing up for the "Mobile Share Value Plan" -- a plan that would separate the cost of their smartphone from the cost of their service. Subscribers who pay for their phone up front, activate an old phone they already own, or pay for their phone in monthly installments, will receive a discount on their monthly bill.|Among subscribers that opt for this plan, cheaper handsets powered by Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android could become far more attractive. AT&T subscribers who switch might be enticed to pick up a less expensive Android phone rather than a more expensive iPhone.|T-Mobile gets fewer iPhone activations than the other carriersLast quarter, T-Mobile sold (as a percentage of total smartphone sales) far fewer of Apple's iPhones than the other major carriers. In total, just 21% of the smartphones T-Mobile sold were iPhones, while more than 50% of Verizon's smartphone sales were Apple-made handsets. Unfortunately, AT&T has stopped disclosing iPhone sales data, but historically, about 80% of the carrier's smartphone sales have come from Apple's iPhones, and though that percentage may have declined somewhat, it's still more than likely far higher than T-Mobile's.|Now, consider the alternative: a standard, two-year contract with AT&T. No matter which phone a subscriber chooses, their monthly bill will be the same -- the only thing that varies is the up-front cost. Picking a cheap handset powered by Google's Android might save an AT&T subscriber a couple hundred dollars up front, but it's hardly worth it -- they're stuck with the phone for two years anyway, so most of them logically choose the higher-quality Apple-made device.|Apple's iPhone business is dependent on subsidiesBut that wouldn't be the case if AT&T wasn't subsidizing Apple's iPhone: It's overwhelming clear that Apple depends on carrier subsidies for its iPhone sales. In emerging markets, where most carriers don't subsidize phones, Google's Android dominates. Where phone subsidies are relatively generous (like in the U.S. or Japan), Apple accounts for a large portion of the market.|That's why this trend toward reduced carrier subsidies should be worrying for Apple. Despite T-Mobile's recent growth, it remains one of the nation's smallest carriers -- but AT&T is the second largest. AT&T isn't abolishing subsidies entirely, but its new plan gives subscribers the option of forgoing subsidies in favor of reduced monthly bills.|If many of AT&T's subscribers take the company up on the offer, or if the trend away from smartphone subsidies continues, Apple's iPhone business could come under pressure in the coming quarters.|Now let's see, AT&T subsidizes Apple -- not in my experience! I pay AT&T about $100 a month to use their service for my iPhone. A fraction of that goes to subsidize the phone, the rest is billions of dollars in business that Apple brings to AT&T!|"Will AT&T's New Plan Crush Apple's iPhone Business?" Methinks not. The author of this article does not present a compelling argument to support his thesis. He fails to point out out that T-Mobile recently launched the JUMP upgrade program that enables users to upgrade their phone twice every 12 months. JUMP is likely to be very popular with current and prospective iPhone users. The fact that the iPhone was "just" 21% of T-Mobile's business last quarter is actually a testament to Apple's overall strength when you consider the fact that T-Mobile didn't even offer the iPhone until quite recently.|Why would AT&T try to "crush" its own business? Android phones are used much less to access the Intermet (data from independent analytics sources) and as the main income of carriers comes from selling data to customers AT&T would be trying to encourage the sale of phones that generate less income? Maybe you should change the title: Will AT&T's new plan crush its own business? But that would not generate traffic...|Every new thing is supposed to be the iPhone or iPad killer, yet never is. Apple, who put the smart phone on the map sells record amounts of each of their newest devices, and should AT&T actually move forward with this plan as you stated then the only thing they will accomplish is to send a bunch of their iPhone customer base over to Verizon, which is where they should be anyhow since AT&T stinks.|A lot of other countries already do this. Why it is such a big deal. Germany has the option of buying a phone out right or doing monthly payments for the phone. the US phone carriers only care about stupid money and the way to F*** over the customer. AT &T always changes there plans that is why they are so messed up... Why don't they start thinking about the customer and not about their pocket books and more customers would be happy with them. Al the news is always about AT&T changing something or screwing over their customers. Look at Verizon they are hardly ever in the news,, guess they are doing something right.|Sam, your anti-Apple bias is showing. AT&T's new plan will make it easier for Apple iPhone's new customers to finance their iPhone. They're NOT going to dump their iPhone for an Android because of AT&T's "new plan". Just the opposite. And Verizon is a far better company anyway - so they can dump AT&T and migrate. Or to T Mobile which is an even friendlier company. It's about Apple's ecosystem and their far better user experience and the fact ALL Apple devices can interact with one another whereas Android's can't. Forget AT&T - all they are is the "fat dumb pipe" and they have lots of competition.|Furthermore, T-Mobile's iPhone sales are a small portion of its total sales, especially compared to AT&T's 80% reliance on iPhone sales. Countries that don't subsidized, particularly in Europe have very low iPhone adoption rates.

Further, in Latin America -- one of the fastest-growing commercial airline markets -- Airbus has outsold Boeing in five of the past six years. More importantly, in 2014, Airbus said it expects its market share to eclipse Boeing's. Here's what else you need to know.|Boeing bites back With Airbus outselling Boeing in Latin America in five of the past six years, it's easy to believe that Airbus will dominate that market. However, Boeing isn't going down without a fight. Donna Hrinak, Boeing's most senior executive in Brazil, said that one of the major factors behind Airbus outselling Boeing is the Airbus A320 neo, which had a launch date of December 2010. Hrinak said, "They came out first with their 'neo', which gave them a headstart on sales." By contrast, Boeing's 737 Max had a launch date of July 2011, so it's had to play catch-up.|Further, Hrinak said that Boeing will continue to keep things competitive in Latin America, and with Boeing estimating that Latin America's fleet will almost triple by 2032 to 3,790 planes, there's no doubt that Boeing will live up to this promise.|What to watch Boeing is a massive company that gets a significant amount of its revenue from commercial airline sales. In addition, as of its third-quarter report, Boeing's backlog was $415 billion. But, as I previously wrote, Boeing has received a few blows when it comes to commercial airline sales -- arguably the most notable being the loss of Japan Airlines to Airbus. What this means is that while Boeing has a significant safety net, there's reason for investors to keep a close eye on Boeing. Airbus is continuing to show that it's a major contender when it comes to commercial airline sales, and Boeing might have to step up its game if it wants to continue being the top dog.|Further, the fight for Latin America is one that investors should especially keep a close eye on. Latin America is one of the fastest growing aviation markets, and if Airbus continues to eat away at Boeing's market share, that's a bad sign for investors. That's not to say it's time to bail on Boeing's stock, but it would be a good idea to continue watching Airbus' performance.|Boeing rewards its investors with dividends Dividend stocks, like Boeing, can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notability of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine. With this in mind, our analysts sat down to identify the absolute best of the best when it comes to rock-solid dividend stocks, drawing up a list in this free report of nine that fit the bill.

AB is currently MAXED out at a 9 year backlog...BOEING is not. and will continue to reduce its back log to 3-5 years...which is optimal. Boeing builds a better product, AB with its cheap cockpits and side stick is not at safe as the yoke design of all BOEING aircraft...AB is cheap and easy....they are in it to provide jobs FIRST...airplanes SECOND....BOEING is in it to provide the BEST aircraft in the WORLD....FIRST and foremost.|rotorhead's reply unfortunately clearly shows he doesn't know the aviation industry too well. First, the notion that Airbus 'cannot increase production' because they 'are a government controlled jobs program' is not only very self-contradictory (if it was a jobs program, increasing production would very much be their goal, as higher production = more jobs), it's also patently false. Airbus WILL increase production, with a decision to increase A32X output yet again expected soon, and production of the new A350 ramping up from next year on. Airbus has expressed the ambition to again overtake Boeing in deliveries in a few years' time, and they have the backlog to achieve just that. Airbus is also not a 'jobs program', Airbus is a highly competitive, and highly profitable company.|Second, Boeing's backlog is almost as big as that of Airbus. It's a bit of an upside-down world though where apparently selling more planes is a BAD thing.

This provided investors a much-needed breather in an otherwise turbulent year that saw Caterpillar's sales and profits dwindle as things worsened in the mining industry.|Mining markets are still in a rut, and demand from key geographic regions like China continues to remain soft. A dour outlook from Caterpillar doesn't help much, either. So what has suddenly excited analysts at Bank of America enough to raise their price target on Caterpillar stock to $100? That's a neat 18% upside from the current share price of around $85. Is Caterpillar hiding something that will push its stock to the three-digit mark soon?|Inside Bank of America's mindInstead of mining or construction, Bank of America is betting on Caterpillar's lesser-known business, power systems. In analysts Ross Gilardi's and Michael Feniger's words, "While the mining and construction equipment outlooks remain murky, the Power Systems business should put a floor under earnings, in our view." The analysts do not expect Caterpillar's 2014 earnings to fall below $4.50 per share.|In a recent post, I had discussed how Caterpillar is underplaying its power systems business. So yes, I think Bank of America is rightly optimistic about the business. But believing that this business alone is enough to propel Caterpillar's growth or support its share price doesn't make much sense.|The power within The power systems division, which include gas engines, turbines, and rail locomotives, has emerged as Caterpillar's highest revenue generator and most profitable business this year. These charts, which break down Caterpillar's revenue and operating profit by segment, will give you the full picture.|Despite all three segments reporting lower revenue and profits year over year, it's clear that Caterpillar's power systems held up the best. That explains Bank of America's optimistic outlook about the business.|But will this last? The question is whether this growth is sustainable, especially when demand for electric power equipment remains weak. That's a major reason why Caterpillar's revenue from the power systems business slipped 7%, year over year during the third quarter.|But unlike Cummins, which has the stronger truck engine market to fall back on, and General Electric, which can offset the weakness in power by strength in its oil & gas business, Caterpillar is more at the mercy of demand for power equipment and locomotives. Though oil and gas is a key category within Caterpillar's power systems business, its exposure is nowhere near to that of General Electric's.|Moreover, General Electric is going places, having recently bagged a massive $2.7 billion contract to power Algeria with its gas turbines. While the benefits of this order should start reflecting in General Electric's numbers next year, Caterpillar doesn't really have much to look forward to.|No visible catalysts here In fact, Caterpillar expects "flat sales" from its power systems business for 2014.|That's certainly a concern, especially when you know that Caterpillar's mining-equipment business is unlikely to stage a comeback next year, and its construction-equipment side isn't doing too well either. While Caterpillar expects sales from construction industries to improve slightly in 2014, it projects revenue from resource industries, or mining equipment, to further decline.|Growth catalysts are clearly lacking, and I can hardly see any signs that could trigger a reversal in Caterpillar's stock price. 2013 has been a disastrous year for the equipment maker, and chances are that Caterpillar will end the financial year with big drops in revenue and profits. With half of the company's sales coming from mining and construction equipment, any deterioration in those end markets going forward could deliver a huge blow to its top and bottom lines.|Foolish takeawayHad Caterpillar's power systems business recorded greater year-over-year sales and profits, investors could have safely bet on it and remained hopeful. Sadly, that's not the case. Investors should also remember that the resource industries has historically been the highest-margin business for Caterpillar. With the better part of Caterpillar's growth plans targeted at mining, not much will happen until that industry recovers.|Meanwhile, if there's anything that will fuel Caterpillar's stock price in near months, it'll probably be positive news from China, because the market tops the company's expansion list. Again, that trigger will have nothing to do with Caterpillar's power systems business.|How to make huge profits from the energy boomCaterpillar may have limited exposure to the oil and gas sector, but some companies are poise to win from the record oil and natural gas production in the United States.The Motley Fool is offering a comprehensive look at three energy companies set to soar during this transformation in the energy industry.

DuPont (NYSE: DD) , the largest U.S. chemicals group by market capitalization, recently announced plans to spin off its low-margin chemicals division, which produces paint pigments, refrigerants and Teflon, following the company's divestment of its performance coatings business in February. Unfortunately, this part of DuPont's business has been letting the side down recently, as pricing pressures in the market caused the division's profit to fall by 38% during the fiscal third quarter.|As DuPont is spinning off, rather than selling, the business, there is scope for the company to benefit from future profits; the company will be able to acquire a stake in the new entity later through a shareholding with limited risk. The same opportunity would not be available if the division was sold to private equity. What's more, spinning off rather than selling the business should be tax-efficient for both investors and DuPont.|All in all, analysts have valued this part of DuPont's business at around $11.5 billion, 20% of DuPont's current market capitalization.|We were rather surprised to see a timid Andrew Liveris comparing his Dow Chemical with half-as-large DuPont in a Bloomberg/Business Week interview published Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2013 by Diane Brady.

As a result, Home Depot boasted the lower cost per visitor share of the two rivals. Home Depot and Lowe's spent $2.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, per visitor share.|Building on a solid foundationDespite Home Depot being crowned the home improvement retailing winner of Black Friday weekend, both Home Depot and Lowe's have been growing at a steady clip. During the past five years, both stocks have outperformed the market. Yet, Home Depot has returned twice as much to its shareholders as has Lowe's.|For its most recent quarter, Home Depot posted same store sales growth of 7.4%, compared to Lowe's 6.2%.

Even with all that growth, the question remains: is Under Armour ready to take on Nike (NYSE: NKE) , its largest U.S. competitor?|Without question, Nike dwarfs Under Armour. Nike's annual revenues are projected to be $27.6 billion, more than 12 times that of Under Armour. Nike's market cap is $70.81 billion, which is eight times more than Under Armour's $8.57 billion. Nike has been growing at a steady pace, with a 10% annual revenue rise over the last three years. Recently, Nike announced a quarterly dividend increase of 14%, while Under Armour offers no dividends. And while Nike is a global brand, Under Armour still depends on North America for over 90% of its revenues.|Product innovation and a unique advantageHere at home, both companies emphasize product innovation to gain bigger footholds in the U.S. health and fitness industry--Under Armour's SpeedForm shoes and Nike's Flyknit footwear are two recent examples of such innovation. Under Armour also recently acquired MapMyRun and MapMyRide mobile apps and websites for $150 million to compete against Nike's FuelBand fitness apps.|There is one category, however, where Under Armour has little competition from Nike. The company's ColdGear Infrared line is targeted to the hunt/fish/camp market, and has been promoted on the popular television program "Duck Dynasty." ColdGear Infrared has helped Under Armour gain a larger share in that market, and Nike has yet to respond to this threat.|Under Armour is up for a fightNike isn't going away any time soon. It remains a solid company in the growing athletic footwear and apparel category. But Under Armour is a competitor that cannot be dismissed. Between the two, Nike is the safer company, but the one with greater potential looks to be Under Armour.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/07/5-reasons-big-red-is-a-big-buy.aspx|12/07/2013|0|"Verizon Communications"|1|In most industries, there isn't one clear leader. However, in the telecommunications business, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is killing the competition. Some of the company's rivals might have higher yields, but by almost every other measure, Verizon is in a class of its own. If you don't already have Verizon on your personal watchlist, add it right now.|Start with the obviousVerizon looks like a buy because of the company's relatively strong revenue growth. Most investors don't get excited about annual revenue growth better than 4%. However, in the telecom business, this result from Verizon was particularly strong. In the same time frame, AT&T (NYSE: T) grew revenue by just over 2% and CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL) reported a revenue decline of roughly 1%.|The second reason investors should consider buying Verizon is the fact that the company's top-line growth led to EPS growth as well. With adjusted EPS up more than 20%, it's like Verizon is operating in a different industry than the other two companies. While AT&T increased EPS annually by more than 6%, CenturyLink saw a decline of almost 8%.|A third vote of confidence for the stock: Analysts expect Verizon to continue beating its competition in terms of future earnings growth. In the next five years, the average analyst expects better than 10% annual EPS growth. Since AT&T is expected to grow earnings by just over 6%, and CenturyLink's growth is pegged at just over 1%, it seems clear that Verizon will continue crushing the competition in the next few years.|The fourth reason to buy Verizon is the company generated $0.18 of core free cash flow from each dollar of sales. By comparison, CenturyLink managed $0.14 during this same timeframe, while AT&T produced $0.10. With such a dominant performance, it's hard to argue that Verizon is a compelling stock to buy.|Growing faster, paying lessThough Verizon is generating more free cash flow per dollar of sales, this might not matter if the company's cash flow isn't growing. Luckily for Verizon shareholders, not only is the company growing its cash flow, but by this measure, Verizon comes out on top again.|The final argument for Verizon's stock: Looking at core operating cash flow (net income plus depreciation), Verizon reported a 13% annual increase over the last nine months. To say this was a dominant performance is an understatement, as AT&T only increased its cash flow by about 2%, and CenturyLink witnessed a decline of 3%.|Combining growing operating cash flow and strong free cash flow generation results in a relatively low free cash flow payout ratio. Over the last nine months, Verizon used just over 27% of its core free cash flow on dividend payments. Considering that CenturyLink used 51% of its free cash flow, and AT&T used more than 75%, the case to buy Verizon looks even stronger.|Buy Big Red to generate big greenNo matter how you look at it, Verizon is doing better than its peers. Though the company's yield is just over 4%, compared to 5% at AT&T and CenturyLink at about 7%, this yield will almost certainly climb.|Whether you are looking for strong revenue growth, earnings growth, or cash flow growth, Verizon has it all. Some industries don't have a clear leader, but in the telecom business, Verizon looks like the best game in town. Smart investors should look to pick up shares of Big Red if they want to generate big green in the future.

The problem with such large stores, however, is that they can't be placed in near proximity to each other without cannibalizing sales. This left a vacuum that was soon filled by competitors like Dollar General and Family Dollar.|What to do? Should Wal-Mart just lay down and die? Or will it be able to get over the indignity of having a handful of deep-discount retailers feed on the scraps it absentmindedly left behind? Suffice it to say, neither of these options seem likely.|At a recent industry conference, Bill Simon, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, laid bare (link opens PDF) the retailer's strategy for mopping up the slop, differentiating between three different types of Wal-Mart locations.|And finally, there's this emerging trip that's immediate access. It used to be more of a convenient store driven trip but with the growth in dollar and drug channels and some of the hard discounters. This trip is one of the fastest growing trip sizes and the Wal-Mart express store has sort of uniquely found a way to participate in that and we can be larger in this segment and we're planning on doing that.|The strategic objective is obviously to fill in the void between supercenters using the now-familiar neighborhood store and the up-and-coming express formats. Wal-Mart already has more than 300 of the former in operation, and it's just now beginning to delve into the latter (of which there are only 20) with earnestness.|In the first case, if Wal-Mart does indeed proceed with its plan to capture every last drop of commerce that settled in the gaps between its superstores, then it's probably smart to start saying your goodbyes to the likes of Dollar General and Family Dollar. Up against a behemoth like Wal-Mart, they aren't long for this world.|The better news, on the other hand, is for investors in Wal-Mart's stock who have worried where additional growth will come from. Suffice it to say, this appears to be the company's answer.|Could Wal-Mart fail at its goal?Given the growth of e-commerce, absolutely.

More than five million customers participated in Wal-Mart's One-Hour Guarantee promotions on Black Friday , while more than 22 million customers shopped at the company's stores on Thanksgiving Day .|Source: Wal-Mart.|Moreover, Wal-Mart sold two million flat screen TVs, 1.4 million tablet devices, 2.8 million towels, and 300,000 bicycles on Black Friday . Not impressed yet? Target also generated strong sales during the biggest shopping day of the year.|1 hidden winner among the discount chainsOverall, Black Friday sales were down 13.2% from last year, according to ShopperTrak . However, 141 million Americans still shopped Black Friday deals both in stores and online this year, according to the National Retail Federation . Moreover, if the initial results from Wal-Mart and Target are any indication, it should be a strong holiday shopping season overall for retailers. These sales figures also bode well for tech giant Apple.|If reports from InfoScout are correct, Apple's 16GB iPad Air was the top selling device at Wal-Mart and Target stores on Black Friday . Both stores were offering impressive Black Friday deals on Apple products. Target, for example, was giving away $100 gift cards with every iPad purchase. On top of this, Target selling Apple's latest version of the device, the iPad Air, for $479 . That's a $20 savings over Apple's price of $499 for a new iPad Air . While we'll have to wait until after the holidays for more insight into Apple's exact retail sales for the period, analysts are optimistic. Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray says that the iPad and iPhone are on track to be among the top gifts of 2013 .

Most retailers did the same, afraid of losing potential sales by opening later.|No choice for Wal-MartWal-Mart isn't so lucky. There is a relatively fixed amount of money that will be spent by consumers this holiday season, and every retailer is trying to get as big a piece as possible. If one big retailer opens its doors earlier than others, not following suit would mean some of that money will be gone by the time any customers get to competitors.|Wal-Mart really has no choice than to match what other retailers are doing, since it can't afford to lose any of those sales. This creates a PR problem, as people begin blaming the company for stealing away Thanksgiving from both consumers as well as employees. Couple that with the PR nightmare caused by Black Friday itself, with reports of customers fighting over towels, of all things, and other ridiculous behavior within its stores. Nothing deters me from shopping somewhere like the prospect of a fistfight over cheap towels.

This isn't necessarily true, but if any of the three companies mentioned here can be classified as immoral due to their Thanksgiving Day policies, it would be Wal-Mart.|Wal-Mart didn't close on Thanksgiving Day. Without the company's grocery section, it would be difficult to imagine revenue exceeding costs for the day, but the grocery section exists, which might make this decision worthwhile.|Wal-Mart reopened at 7 a.m. on Black Friday, with its Black Friday deals beginning at 6 p.m., two hours earlier than last year. Round two of Wal-Mart's Black Friday deals began at 8 p.m.|Wal-Mart sports a somewhat respectable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8, but it generated an enormous $23 billion in operating cash flow over the past year. Therefore, it's easy for Wal-Mart to return capital to its shareholders, even after capital expenditures.|Wal-Mart currently yields 2.3%. It's also trading at 14 times forward earnings, making its valuation more appealing than Whole Foods and Costco, trading at 29 and 25 times forward earnings, respectively.|Wal-Mart attracts a wide range of consumers, many of which are having a difficult time making ends meet. These consumers have been hit by a lack of wage growth, an increased payroll tax, as well as volatile food and gas prices. Therefore, Wal-Mart staying open on Thanksgiving Day seems logical from a business perspective. Every day of extra sales helps.|The bottom lineThe Whole Foods incident should blow over. The stock has been selling off recently due to fears of overvaluation, but it's a high-quality underlying business. Wal-Mart has been delivering sub-par results lately, which makes staying open on Thanksgiving Day justifiable.|Immoral? What is immoral about opening a store on Thanksgiving? Wal-Mart has been open on Thanksgiving for many years. I can remember when stores were closed on Sundays, but thank goodness now stores are open when people have the time to shop.

Sears Holdings has no competitive advantage over Macy's or Wal-MartSears Holdings, Macy's (NYSE: M) , and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) compete with one another in various product lines. Sears has a slight advantage in home appliances -- its specialty -- but Macy's and Wal-Mart can offer at least as good of a deal as Sears in everything else. Aside from home appliances, there is little that differentiates Sears from Macy's and Wal-Mart in a meaningful way and therefore customers switch freely between the three based on price and convenience. In other words, except for a few branded product lines, Sears sells commodity products.|The only way to earn out-sized profits in a commodity business is to be the low-cost producer. In retail, low-cost production comes from massive scale that leads to operating efficiencies. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, has scale that can't be matched. Even so, Morningstar calculates Wal-Mart's return on invested capital in the low teens -- not particularly impressive compared to companies in other industries with similar competitive positions.|If Wal-Mart's return on invested capital only barely hits double-digits, Macy's and Sears Holdings' ROIC must be much lower. Morningstar calculates Macy's return on invested capital in the mid-single digits. Meanwhile, Sears Holdings is not even generating a profit. Macy's is an average business in a highly competitive industry and Sears Holdings is a bad business in the same industry -- neither is in a position to gain significant market share.

The sector as a whole closed the day up 0.6%. By the end of trading, 3M rose $1.78 (1.4%) to $128.61 on average volume. Throughout the day, 2,882,335 shares of 3M exchanged hands as compared to its average daily volume of 2,633,100 shares.

Based on the Sept. 30 13F, this makes ExxonMobil Berkshire's seventh-largest stock holding, worth $3.75 billion. While that's significantly smaller than the company's holdings in Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM,and American Express -- each worth more than $10 billion -- ExxonMobil is perhaps the most "Buffett" of all the companies that Buffett has invested in over the years. Let's take a look at why.|The big-oil version of Berkshire?ExxonMobil has its fingers in every segment of the oil and petrochemical business and is the largest public company in the world. While there's no doubt it's incredibly diversified -- as Berkshire is, with subsidiaries that do everything from lease jets to sell ice cream -- it shares a common trait with Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries like BNSF Railway, GEICO, and MidAmerican Energy, as well as Berkshire's large public investments like Coca-Cola, all of which are actually pretty specialized and focused on what they do best. Coca-Cola, which has become one of Buffett's signature investments over the years, doesn't compete with peer PepsiCo in the snack business, instead remaining focused on its core beverage business.|Renewables like wind and solar are becoming a growing part of the energy future (and Berkshire subsidiary MidAmerican is heavily invested in both), but cheap energy from oil and natural gas is projected to remain central to how we power the future, and petrochemicals will remain industrial mainstays in the decades to come. Buffett surely sees this, and he's betting (to the tune of more than $3 billion) that ExxonMobil will be in the middle of the most profitable parts of it.|Maybe Buffett's best investment in EnergyImagine a company that rents a very specific and valuable piece of machinery for $41,000 per hour (that's almost as much as the average American makes in a year!). And Warren Buffett is so confident in this company's can't-live-without-it business model, he just loaded up on 8.8 million shares.

Telecom giant Verizon (NYSE: VZ) provides a perfect example of this problem. Verizon's stock has provided one of the highest yields on the Dow for years, even as its share prices marched ever higher during the smartphone boom. Verizon still offers the second-highest yield on the Dow today, second only to sector rival AT&T (NYSE: T) . The low-growth cash machines of the telecom industry churn out stellar dividends regardless of short-term cycles in their share prices.|Yes, AT&T makes an appearance. The Dow's highest yield of 5.3% comes with the third-worst stock performance. Year to date, AT&T shares have gained just 1.6% versus the Dow's 21%.|If you buy into the Dogs of the Dow philosophy, you have to assume that AT&T, Chevron, and McDonald's are high-quality companies whose stocks are on a temporary fire sale. Again, I've tempered the basic Dogs template with a closer look at recent underperformers, so we're not looking at a simple list of high-yielding cash-cow business models.|This dog might not hunt after allAT&T faces the biggest challenges in this trio. Smartphones are still selling like hotcakes, but the service plans that make them profitable are getting simpler across the board. Smaller telecoms are banding together to create larger AT&T rivals with strong economies of scale. Ma Bell has started losing sales to these rising stars.|Turning AT&T around in 2014 is not an impossible task, but the company's management must make some drastic changes to its customer acquisition tactics. AT&T has always relied on its sector-crushing scale and solid reputation to set it apart from smaller and less experienced networks. That's not good enough anymore, and AT&T needs to become a leader instead of following industry shifts a couple of years after their invention.|The Foolish takeawayThere's my pack of dogs for 2014. All of them are up against formidable challenges, which explains their discount pricing. But that's what contrarian investing is all about -- grab the deep-discount stocks just before they bounce back. Chevron and McDonald's look like good bets for the coming year; I'm more worried about AT&T.

This is a growing trend in the wireless industry, and one that Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) may see a benefit from with its low-cost, mid-range Nexus smartphone line.|With each big phone release, wireless carriers like AT&T take an earnings hit as they pay out millions of subsidies to new phone customers. Of course, subscriber fees eventually make up for the lost profits, but it's quite a bumpy ride for shareholders. The last two years have seen a correlation between iPhone releases and a drop in fourth quarter net income for AT&T.|As you can see, AT&T gets punished when it does a good job and sells a bunch of new phones. Selling too many phones with high subsidies can result in an earnings miss, which, regardless of the reason, never looks good.|Motorola announced last week that it would move up the U.S. release date of its Moto G GSM model (which supports AT&T and T-Mobile). Although it's unlikely the move was in conjunction with AT&T's newest offer, it's clear Motorola is targeting the no-subsidy smartphone market with the Moto G.|No subsidy, no problemThe move by AT&T will help smooth out its earnings results, and could be a boon to Google's value-priced phones. For customers buying a new phone off-contract, the value propositions of the Nexus 5 or Moto G are quite enticing. I expect stronger sales of the Nexus line of phones, and potentially more Google Play revenue as more carriers follow T-Mobile's lead.|AT&T is US based and Apple has outsold Android smartphones in the USA this year, so wouldn't this help Apple more than Google. Google sells what, 1% of the phones in the USA itself, so how does this help Google more than Apple?|After a lengthy online chat with an AT&T representative (chat session available on request), you cannot officially bring a Nexus 5 purchased from the Google Play store and use it off-contract at AT&T. They did say that Customer Care could potentially do something for me in that case, but at least "online", that is not an option.

T-Mobile just raised about $4 billion through a second stock offering and sale of senior notes, which the company could use in bidding for the wireless spectrum. If AT&T and T-Mobile both want the spectrum enough, they could start a bidding war that ends with the spectrum going to the one with the deepest pockets.|T-Mobile is the smallest of the four major U.S. wireless carriers, and buying up additional spectrum would allow the company to handle additional customer data usage. For AT&T, the purchase could mean holding on to as much wireless spectrum as possible to retain an advantage over the smaller -- but quickly growing -- T-Mobile.|Pricing warsBuying up spectrum isn't the only way the two carriers may battle it out. This week AT&T announced that starting Dec. 8 it will reduce monthly charges for certain no-contract subscribers. The plan is called Mobile Share Value and customers who buy a phone without a subsidy, sign up for AT&T Next, or bring their own device to the network will pay up to $15 less per month than they previously did.|The move is an effort by the carrier to compete directly with T-Mobile's no-contract plans. But as The Verge pointed out, some of the AT&T plans with multiple users on a shared plan will actually see their monthly prices go up. Overall, though, the pricing should help some AT&T subscribers save money, but still won't quite match T-Mobile's pricing deals.|Foolish final thoughtsAT&T's change in pricing strategy for some customers shows just how much T-Mobile is starting to influence the other U.S. wireless carriers -- no matter how big they are. T-Mobile is still the dark horse right now, but its pricing model has started to resonate with customers, and in the third quarter of this year it gained more than 1 million net customers, including prepaid subscribers.|T-Mobile still falls short of both AT&T's network coverage and number of customers, but AT&T's pricing change and its possible competitive bid against T-Mobile for wireless spectrum shows that the "uncarrier" strategy may be paying off. Investors should watch how the spectrum bid plays out and also look for AT&T's next quarterly earnings for any news on how the contract changes have helped or hurt the company. AT&T may have made the changes simply in order to keep current customers from jumping ship, rather than trying to win over new ones who are looking for a better mobile plan deal.

Therefore, at $2.4 million per visitor share, Minneapolis-based Target harnessed the second-best cost-per-share metric of the retailers analyzed.|Wal-Mart|Taking a look at these figures coupled with the cost-per-visitor-share metric, we can see that while Wal-Mart spends less of its revenue on things like advertising, each dollar it spends on TV ads generally translates into more share. By comparison, Sears spends a greater percentage of its revenue on SG&A expenses, but receives much less share. As a result, Wal-Mart appears to spend money efficiently and not waste its cash flow. The same can't be said for Sears.|The changing face of retailWhile Wal-Mart is a force to be reckoned with, two retailers are turning the industry on its head.

Between 2008 and 2012, this market also saw an annual growth rate of 19%, and it is expected to reach $1 trillion within the next six years. With such enormous scale and accelerating growth at stake, traditional retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) have been increasing their e-commerce exposure in the last five years. With more than $50 billion in online sales in 2012, however, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the clear market leader.|Aware of the intense competition in the online retail space, the team decided to focus on a particular niche that was unserved. They focused on building an online platform for bulk orders, a segment traditionally dominated by big club retailers such as Sam's Club and Costco, because they could build an economic moat faster by saving time for customers who are either too busy or live too far away from a warehouse club. As Quartz contributor Christopher Mims notes, if Amazon is the online Wal-Mart, Boxed aims to be the online Costco.|Fighting against Amazon.com and Wal-MartTo remain competitive against Amazon.com (which has spent more than $14 billion on 50 warehouses since 2010) or Wal-Mart (which is transforming its more than 4,000 U.S. locations into an efficient distribution network), Boxed decided to rent its own warehouses in Las Vegas and New Jersey. These cities were chosen due to their proximity to most cities located on either the east or west coast.|Final Foolish takeaway The retail industry is probably the most competitive space, with Wal-Mart dominating the traditional segment by employing an "every day low prices" strategy, Costco controlling the warehouse segment, and Amazon.com ruling the online space. Boxed demonstrated that it is possible to build out an economic moat from zero, even in such a fierce landscape. To achieve this, the key ingredients involve focusing on a specific -- preferably unserved -- niche, developing for mobile, and keeping a light and efficient logistics system.

PetSmart's broad portfolio of 11,000 store products and 10,000 online items has been the key driver of this growth. PetSmart carries nationally recognized brands as well as proprietary brands. However, when it comes to the pet supply market, what separates PetSmart from other companies that offer pet supplies, like retail behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , is its pet services.|For instance, PetSmart offers pet training, day camp for dogs, boarding, and PetsHotels (169 of them), the latter of which comes with 24-hour supervision. The key point here is that while Amazon and Wal-Mart are capable of stealing market share for pet supplies, they can't compete with PetSmart's pet services, which gives the company differentiation.|If you're looking to invest in a highly resilient company, then you might want to consider Wal-Mart. The company's results haven't been surpassing expectations recently, but Wal-Mart continuously finds ways to grow, including the future introduction of its small-box stores to steal market share from the dollar stores. Wal-Mart also yields 2.4%, which will help limit any downside pain. PetSmart currently yields 1.1%.

Good news for investors is that, if early orders are any indication, Boeing's next-generation 777X airplane is going to be a huge hit. It dominated the recent Dubai Airshow, garnering roughly $100 billion in orders at list prices. It's a great product, to be sure, and will provide cash-strapped airlines with a 12% savings in fuel cost over any competing aircraft. However, investors want to avoid the kind of production mistakes and delays seen with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.|The problems with the 787 arose largely because Boeing moved its production to a new site, which caused issues and delays. Boeing has to avoid that this time, which puts it between a rock and a hard place because the machinists' union at its Everett plant in Washington state, which has knowledge and experience building 777 airplanes, rejected the company's contract offer by a two-thirds majority. Now Boeing has to decide within the next three months if it will keep its production in Washington, regardless of the union action, or risk customer satisfaction by moving to a new site with potential production problems. There is a tax break and incentive war raging between 15 states that would very much welcome Boeing 777X production and accompanying jobs.|Dividend stocks like Ford and Boeing can make you richIt's as simple as that.

Shares are down 20% since late October, as Ciena has been feeling the effects of sorry guidance by networking and telecom bellwether Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) .|Cisco's bane, Ciena's painCisco shares had taken a big hit early in November after it missed revenue estimates for the first quarter. To make things worse, Cisco guided for an 8%-10% decline in revenue for the current quarter. This sparked fears of a slowdown in telecom and networking spending, triggering a 13% drop in Cisco's share price. According to Reuters, at least 17 brokerages cut their price targets on Cisco, while Goldman Sachs removed it from its conviction list.|Since Cisco is the leading technology equipment supplier, its weak performance weighed in on other equipment makers as well, and Ciena was one of them. But does Ciena deserve to be a part of Cisco's pain? Probably not. Cisco suffered because sales in the emerging markets slowed down in the wake of the recent surveillance allegations, as most of the data is routed through Cisco's equipment.|As such, the problems seem Cisco-centric rather than industry-centric. In my opinion, it does not make sense to sell Ciena over its competitor's problems. Ciena has been doing very well and, despite the recent pullback, shares are up around 40% this year. It has been performing well ahead of expectations and the trend looks set to continue.

With an estimated 43 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, West Qurna is estimated to be the second largest oil field on the planet. Reports also say that ExxonMobil sold an additional 10% stake to Indonesia's state oil company, PT Pertamina.|With these moves, ExxonMobil's ongoing divestment in West Qurna is over half completed. PetroChina, for its part, is now the single largest player in this huge field. The two companies are going in opposite directions, but in the grand scheme of Iraq's complicated internal political situation, the deal stands to benefit both parties greatly.|Iraq is a lot more than just this one (admittedly enormous) field, and ExxonMobil has an opportunity for much better margins dealing with the Kurdistan Regional Government on smaller northern fields. When ExxonMobil made it clear it was going this route, it sparked major threats from Iraqi officials, who told them to choose between Kurdistan and West Qurna. Juggling politics between the autonomous Kurds and the Iraqi central government is tricky business, and ExxonMobil has chosen the relative calm of Iraqi Kurdistan over the higher profile southeast.|Kurdistan enjoys close ties with the U.S. (former U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith helped negotiate the Iraqi constitution on Kurdistan's behalf to secure them friendly terms on oil revenue sharing), and ExxonMobil is in a great position to take advantage of these fields, with easy access to Western markets by way of Turkey.|A win-winIn selling out, which is still an ongoing process, ExxonMobil doesn't lose its own status as a major candidate for any development deals, but it will free itself from any leverage the Iraqi central government may wish to exert on it for its work in Kurdistan. For PetroChina, the West Qurna field is no burden at all, but rather an opportunity to prove its maturation into one of the world's big players in oil production.

We continue to review the resource and will ask the vendor to make changes as needed."|In total, the tips add up to hundreds, if not more than a thousand dollars of gift suggestions for McDonald's workers, many of whom earn just above minimum wage.

It takes considerable time and money to usher them through trials and commercialization. As a result, it wasn't surprising to see Vertex price its Incivek at $49,000 for the 12-week course of treatment when it reached market back in 2011. That price was well above the $15,000-$20,000 patients were paying for prior-generation treatments interferon and ribavirin. Merck's Victrelis carried a similarly higher price tag -- as much as $48,000 for the longest course of treatment.|Similar to the warehousing of patients ahead of Vertex's Incivek and Merck's Victrelis, doctors seem to have been holding off on treating patients this year, too.|Merck also hopes its MK-5172 can make its way to market as a successor to Victrelis. In a small patient population, MK-5172, when combined with fellow candidate MK-8742, produced between a 96% and 100% cure rate during a Phase 2 trial. That was good enough for the FDA to grant the combination coveted breakthrough status.

This vaccine is then injected into a patient to stimulate his or her immune system to fight off subsequent exposures to the pathogen. DARPA, however, appears to be tasking Pfizer with finding a shortcut, whereby all of this would happen in vivo, within the patient's body, thus dramatically cutting the time between the discovery of a pathogen and the military's ability to treat it. Incidentally, if Pfizer is successful in this work, its research could have significant applications in the civilian world as well.

Unilever (NYSE: UL) also restructured its business to drive future operating performance. Unilever has sold several slower-growth, non-core food businesses such as North American frozen meals and Skippy peanut butter. It also divested two of its main European frozen food brands, Bird's Eye and Igloo, and sold the Wish-Bone and Western Dressings brands to Pinnacle Foods. Moreover, Unilever also cut unprofitable businesses which only added to its volumes. Unilever expects to reduce its brand portfolio from 1,600 to 400 by 2015 so it can focus its resources and efforts on growing its personal and home care businesses.|Another big global consumer player, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) is also pursuing corporate restructuring. It announced that it will restructure its brand portfolio by increasing its business divisions from two to four segments which will include baby, feminine, and family care, home care, beauty and health, and grooming. The division redesign could accelerate the company's global expansion and innovation, improving the company's financial performance.|My Foolish takeThe health care spin-off could drive Kimberly-Clark's long-term shareholder value as the company can focus its efforts on growing other consumer businesses. Kimberly-Clark could fit into the long-term portfolio of an income investor with its juicy 3% dividend yield. The same logic applies to Unilever and Procter & Gamble with their global leading positions and their nice dividend yields of 3.70% and 2.80%, respectively.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/05/will-amazon-still-be-a-buy-at-400.aspx|12/05/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|3|If we look throughout retail, Amazon still looks pricey. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) ,for instance, trades at 0.56 times sales. Wal-Mart is the largest retail company in the world, and if we're trying to determine if Amazon is expensive relative to its retail business, then we have to compare it to the best.|There is another element to the story, however, and that is growth. If we use Thanksgiving and Black Friday as a comparison, ShopperTrak estimates that brick-and-mortar stores rose just 2.3% year over- ear while e-commerce grew a whopping 17.3%. Therefore, Wal-Mart and Amazon are on two completely different levels of growth. As seen with AWS, higher premiums are normally awarded for growth.|With that said, Amazon is growing 10 times faster than Wal-Mart but is only 3.5 times more expensive. This fact is a good indication of investment value.|What about earnings?Right now, bears are probably screaming that price times sales is not a fair metric. After all, Wal-Mart trades at just 14.4 times next year's earnings versus a forward P/E ratio of 146 for Amazon.|The problem with this argument is that net income or earnings is not a good valuation metric for companies at different stages in their growth cycle. Amazon is investing heavily in growth -- including new segments such as grocery -- while expanding its infrastructure. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, is large and well-established.|It is worth noting that in both Amazon's and Wal-Mart's most recent quarter, Amazon actually had a higher gross profit margin. Amazon's gross profit margin was 27.6% versus 25% for Wal-Mart. This suggests that Amazon might one day achieve profit margins greater than Wal-Mart's 3.6% once its aggressive spending subsides.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/05/the-saddest-thing-about-the-minimum-wage-controver.aspx|12/05/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|36|Big boxes, small wagesWal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has been the whipping boy for its employee treatment for ages. This is probably because the retailer is so high-profile -- the company's market cap is $258 billion and in the last 12 months the discount giant raked in $475 billion in sales. Wal-Mart reveals its own impressive reach on its website: Every week, 254 million people enter a Wal-Mart. It currently has 11,000 stores in 27 countries, and regardless of how much it pays, it hands out paychecks to 2.2 million people across the globe.|It probably has a target on its back precisely because of its massive and visible footprint. It has so much power and influence -- Wal-Mart does something, everybody listens.|The truth is that Wal-Mart isn't the only offender.|Employees of companies like Mickey D's are beginning their plans for demonstrations in 100 cities. A common demand is doubling their wages from the minimum-wage floor. Like Wal-Mart, McDonald's garners more headlines -- again, it can now boast billions served.|Here's a weird twist: Sometimes companies like Wal-Mart derive benefits from welfare and public assistance, since they're not shelling out more for employees. Given low wages, it relies or at least encourages government assistance itself; its employees can't do much at all with their wages. Plus in the long run, demoralized employees and increasing public distaste hurt such companies, they don't help them.|While big companies like Wal-Mart and MCD probably would not go out of business or lay off lots of employees because of a min. wage increase but the companies would probably see a slow down in growth (WMT and MCD are both treading water right now anyway) and it would likely also affect customer service -- longer waits at the drive though or counter probably. Smaller companies would be affected more.|Huh? Can't McDonald's employees afford to buy food at McDonald's? Can't Wal-Mart employees afford to shop at Wal-Mart? Isn't the Henry Ford example just proving that employees are fairly compensated by current standards?|Huh? McDonald's started in 1948 and Wal-Mart in 1962. Those are pretty long runs for a strategy of "long-term obtuseness" using "demoralized employees". Neither company has needed intervention (whatever that means) or suffered considerable harm from "public distaste".|* "Sometimes companies like Wal-Mart derive benefits from welfare and public assistance, since they're not shelling out more for employees."|Huh? Does this mean Wal-Mart also derives benefit from public education because it doesn't have to pay to educate its employees' children? Does it derive benefit from the US military because it doesn't have to pay for its own militia? Why should Wal-Mart feel guilty because its employees receive government benefits that tax dollars paid for?

Last month, the White House backed a bill that would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10 an hour. Today, a movement demanding $15 per hour for fast-food workers is sponsoring a one-day strike across 100 cities in the U.S., expanding a 50-city strike that occurred on Aug. 29.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/04/the-curse-of-the-smartphone.aspx|12/04/2013|0|"AT&T"|4|You've probably seen or read an article in last few years about how wireless carriers both love and hate smartphones. On one hand, companies like AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) benefit when a customer chooses a smartphone, because they are required to pay for a data plan for their device. However, the high subsidy that these devices normally require can take many months to recoup. Although AT&T looks like a good buy based on the company's yield of more than 5%, there may not be a clearer picture of the curse of the smartphone.|With AT&T, Verizon, and Windstream (NASDAQ: WIN) all reporting landline losses of at least 6% in their current quarters, it's obvious that each company must make up for the loss of this revenue and cash flow. While AT&T and Verizon have their wireless divisions to fall back on, Windstream must turn to high-speed Internet, video, and enterprise offerings to try and make up these losses.|Low and slowIn a recurring theme, AT&T seems to constantly play second fiddle to Verizon when it comes to their respective wireless operations. For instance, AT&T reported wireless revenue growth of over 5%, whereas Verizon grew its wireless revenue by more than 7%. What is slightly more troubling, is AT&T also reported a lower operating margin of just over 26% in its wireless operations compared to a nearly 34% margin at Verizon.|Based on the above numbers, it's not surprising that Verizon is also growing revenue per user faster than the old Ma Bell. AT&T reported average revenue per user increased by 1.5%, while Verizon reported an increase of more than 7%. Whether it's AT&T's low wireless margin or slow revenue growth, AT&T investors should be seeing red.|3 warning signsThe first issue facing AT&T is, over the last nine months, the company's core operating cash flow (net income + depreciation) increased by just 1.7%. By comparison, Windstream was able to increase this same measure by roughly half of a percent. Given that Windstream doesn't have the growth engine of AT&T Wireless, AT&T's results are worrisome. When you consider that Verizon increased its core operating cash flow by 13%, this worry becomes a big red flag.|The second concern facing AT&T investors is, their company is generating free cash flow at a lower rate than they might expect. Both Windstream and AT&T generated $0.10 of free cash flow per dollar of sales in the last nine months. Verizon, on the other hand, nearly doubled this production with $0.18 of free cash flow from each dollar of sales.|Third, AT&T's free cash flow payout ratio could be an issue. For point of reference, Windstream's core free cash flow (net income + depreciation-capital expenditures) payout ratio came in at 97% in the last nine months. AT&T reported stronger revenue growth, but posted a payout ratio of more than 75% in the same timeframe. Once again, Verizon topped both of its peers with a core free cash flow payout ratio of just over 27%.|Final thoughtsOf the three companies we've looked at, only AT&T and Verizon have to worry about smartphone penetration. The difference is, while Verizon's total smartphone penetration is still less than 70%, AT&T sits at 75%.|AT&T has to pay higher subsidies than Verizon since more of its customers are smartphone users. These higher subsidies eat into margins, lower margins lead to lower cash flow, and in the end, AT&T's higher payout ratio.|Investors can also see AT&T's challenges based on the fact that analysts expect the company to grow earnings by just over 6% annually in the next five years, as compared to the better than 10% growth expected from Verizon.|In fact, it seems like AT&T and Windstream have a lot more in common than some investors would like to admit. Both companies have slow operating cash flow growth, relatively high payout ratios, and challenges keeping up with their competitors. While Windstream at least offers investors a double digit yield to compensate for its other weaknesses, AT&T pays a yield that is just slightly more than Verizon.|Almost no matter how you look at it, AT&T is suffering from a curse that can't easily be cured. It might be wise for investors to exorcise this stock from their portfolio before their returns are cursed as well.

And for those who examine them, many of the company's key metrics seem to lay waste to its rock-bottom valuations. For instance, Deere's trailing price-earnings ratio sits at about 9 times, compared with 16 times for Caterpillar and 13.5 times for CNH. That discrepancy exists despite Deere's operating margin of 14.5%, compared to 9% for Caterpillar and just over 7% for CNH.|Looking further, Deere's return on equity is a heady 41%, versus Caterpillar's 19% and CNH's rate approaching 16%.

For years, its share price gained due to high demand for agricultural and construction equipment. But more recently, even though revenue has continued to climb, less of those profits have made it through to the bottom line. Can Titan reverse that trend and get earnings growing again, or will the industry headwinds that have already affected sales at Deere and Caterpillar eventually push Titan's revenue down as well? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Titan Machinery over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.

Buffett's most famous holding (and favorite daily beverage) is Coca-Cola, but at 16.5% of his portfolio, it represents a smaller stake than his largest holding, Wells Fargo, which accounts for 20.8% of his portfolio.|Mr. Buffett could be describing Coca-Cola in episode 2 of Secret Millionaires Club. The kids are trying to make a car wash successful. Mr. Buffett advises the kids to advertise: "Every business needs to promote itself ... to distinguish itself from its competitors. When a business advertises, it builds its brand and gains the larger share of the customer's mind." Coca-Cola regularly ranks among the world's most valuable and widely recognized brands.|Coca-Cola has been fairly flat over the last year, with declining U.S. soda consumption impacting both Coke and rivals including PepsiCo. Coca-Cola, unlike PepsiCo, doesn't have a massive global snacks business to offset dropping soda sales. However, Coca-Cola has plenty of noncarbonated beverages that it could advertise more to mitigate slacking soda sales.|Coke stock offers a 2.8% yield and a trailing earnings multiple of 20.8.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/04/the-curse-of-the-smartphone.aspx|12/04/2013|0|"Verizon Communications"|5|You've probably seen or read an article in last few years about how wireless carriers both love and hate smartphones. On one hand, companies like AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) benefit when a customer chooses a smartphone, because they are required to pay for a data plan for their device. However, the high subsidy that these devices normally require can take many months to recoup. Although AT&T looks like a good buy based on the company's yield of more than 5%, there may not be a clearer picture of the curse of the smartphone.|With AT&T, Verizon, and Windstream (NASDAQ: WIN) all reporting landline losses of at least 6% in their current quarters, it's obvious that each company must make up for the loss of this revenue and cash flow. While AT&T and Verizon have their wireless divisions to fall back on, Windstream must turn to high-speed Internet, video, and enterprise offerings to try and make up these losses.|Low and slowIn a recurring theme, AT&T seems to constantly play second fiddle to Verizon when it comes to their respective wireless operations. For instance, AT&T reported wireless revenue growth of over 5%, whereas Verizon grew its wireless revenue by more than 7%. What is slightly more troubling, is AT&T also reported a lower operating margin of just over 26% in its wireless operations compared to a nearly 34% margin at Verizon.|Based on the above numbers, it's not surprising that Verizon is also growing revenue per user faster than the old Ma Bell. AT&T reported average revenue per user increased by 1.5%, while Verizon reported an increase of more than 7%. Whether it's AT&T's low wireless margin or slow revenue growth, AT&T investors should be seeing red.|3 warning signsThe first issue facing AT&T is, over the last nine months, the company's core operating cash flow (net income + depreciation) increased by just 1.7%. By comparison, Windstream was able to increase this same measure by roughly half of a percent. Given that Windstream doesn't have the growth engine of AT&T Wireless, AT&T's results are worrisome. When you consider that Verizon increased its core operating cash flow by 13%, this worry becomes a big red flag.|The second concern facing AT&T investors is, their company is generating free cash flow at a lower rate than they might expect. Both Windstream and AT&T generated $0.10 of free cash flow per dollar of sales in the last nine months. Verizon, on the other hand, nearly doubled this production with $0.18 of free cash flow from each dollar of sales.|Third, AT&T's free cash flow payout ratio could be an issue. For point of reference, Windstream's core free cash flow (net income + depreciation-capital expenditures) payout ratio came in at 97% in the last nine months. AT&T reported stronger revenue growth, but posted a payout ratio of more than 75% in the same timeframe. Once again, Verizon topped both of its peers with a core free cash flow payout ratio of just over 27%.|Final thoughtsOf the three companies we've looked at, only AT&T and Verizon have to worry about smartphone penetration. The difference is, while Verizon's total smartphone penetration is still less than 70%, AT&T sits at 75%.|AT&T has to pay higher subsidies than Verizon since more of its customers are smartphone users. These higher subsidies eat into margins, lower margins lead to lower cash flow, and in the end, AT&T's higher payout ratio.|Investors can also see AT&T's challenges based on the fact that analysts expect the company to grow earnings by just over 6% annually in the next five years, as compared to the better than 10% growth expected from Verizon.|In fact, it seems like AT&T and Windstream have a lot more in common than some investors would like to admit. Both companies have slow operating cash flow growth, relatively high payout ratios, and challenges keeping up with their competitors. While Windstream at least offers investors a double digit yield to compensate for its other weaknesses, AT&T pays a yield that is just slightly more than Verizon.

The deal, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both companies' shareholders, is still expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.|Verizon had reportedly said it would try to sell the A-block spectrum, when it was seeking regulatory approval last year for a $3.9 billion deal to buy a different piece of spectrum from a group of cable companies.|Although Verizon did not reach a deal for the A-block at that time, it sold adjacent airwaves in the so-called B-block to AT&T for $1.9 billion as part of that process. The 700 MHz B block spectrum licenses covers 42 million people in 18 states and added to AT&T's 4G LTE network.|The WSJ reported that A block of airwaves, in the lower 700 megahertz frequency, is highly valued for its ability to carry signals for long distances and penetrate buildings. The Verizon spectrum is in the "A" block is in the lower 700 megahertz frequency. Verizon and AT&T own roughly 75 percent of the low-band spectrum currently in use by wireless carriers.|AT&T, like other carriers, is seeking spectrum to carry growing data traffic and the Verizon airwaves fit well with its current holdings.

Having rebounded from its worst levels a year ago, the stock is still well off levels it hit in early 2012, and with Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) fighting to capture more cash-strapped shoppers, Big Lots faces competition on all fronts.|For years, Big Lots benefited from the trend toward more aggressive discounting of retail goods, with a focus that greatly resembled a larger-format dollar store. Yet more recently, Big Lots has struggled to find growth, and even though Target and Wal-Mart have also found it difficult to produce the growth rates that investors would prefer to see, they at least have their much greater size to explain their sluggishness in raising revenue. Big Lots faces the challenge of staying relevant as pure dollar stores compete from below while retailers reach down to try to capture market share. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Big Lots over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|To compete more effectively, Big Lots has taken a page from Dollar General and some of its dollar-store rivals, offering some frozen and refrigerated goods to bring more customers into its stores. That strategy could help Big Lots broaden its appeal beyond the somewhat haphazard offerings of closeout merchandise that it buys from manufacturers looking to sell off some of their inventory at discounted prices. The closeout business produces bargains that Wal-Mart and Target can't match, but the problem is that consumers can't necessarily rely on those deals ever repeating, making it hard to predict whether the store will have items that customers want on any given visit.|Still, Big Lots faces big challenges. The company is working hard to replace underperforming stores with new ones in more favorable locations. But that leaves it in a poor competitive position against Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have well-established locations that are in many cases ideally located to serve their targeted demographics. That's likely one reason why Big Lots plans to close its wholesale operations, with the goal of trying to emphasize its higher-margin businesses to maximize overall profit.|The right way to play retailLook beyond Big Lots and find out about two retailers with especially good prospects.

Sporting a yield of 5.1% and a market capitalization of more than $180 billion, AT&T competes in the highly competitive world of wireless and landline communications. It's a business in flux as wireless grows, cable declines, and landline looks almost archaic.|Does AT&T's size provide safety for its dividend despite the changes in its business? It would seem so. The company has paid a dividend for the past 29 years, although the dividend has increased only modestly year over year. The payout ratio has fluctuated over the years, with 2012 recording a payout ratio of 144%, which is clearly unsustainable. However, the past three quarters have shown AT&T's earnings to exceed its dividend payment.|AT&T looks like a large -- and some would say lumbering -- company in a fast-moving industry. Return on equity is an uninspiring 8.3%, and its profit margin is an equally pedestrian 5.8%. AT&T's earnings growth is erratic, and its debt-to-equity ratio is greater than 89. AT&T won't stun the world with spectacular growth, but it also won't collapse into oblivion any time soon.|Supersize that dividend growthMuch like AT&T in telecommunications, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) dominates the fast food business. Like AT&T, McDonald's operates in a highly competitive environment. However, the dividend story differs significantly here. McDonald's current dividend yields 3.3%, which is smaller than AT&T's. Its dividend growth surpasses AT&T's, though: The Golden Arches' dividend has grown more than 62% since 2010, while AT&T's has grown less than 10%.|From an investment perspective, McDonald's makes a more compelling case than AT&T. While facing substantial competition and likely slow growth in the U.S. and Europe, McDonald's sees opportunity in Asia and emerging markets. While the dividend yields less than AT&T's, the payout ratio is generally lower and more stable. McDonald's return on equity comes in at an impressive 36% but its debt-to-equity ratio matches AT&T's 89.|AT&T offers the highest immediate yield, but with the slowest dividend growth and limited capital-gains prospects. McDonald's offers the lowest yield, but has the greatest rate of dividend growth. Its track record of capital gains isn't bad, either. Enterprise offers a yield that's just under AT&T's, but with significantly better distribution growth. Enterprise also sports a better capital-gains record than McDonald's. Given the growth potential of the U.S. energy market, Enterprise looks well-positioned to grow its distribution for years.

In Q3, that dropped to just 10%, well below the iPhone's market share at AT&T (NYSE: T) , Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , or Sprint (NYSE: S) .|AT&T was the exclusive home of the iPhone in the U.S. until 2011. As a result, it has maintained a large base of loyal iPhone users. In last year's Q4, a stunning 84% of all AT&T smartphone sales were iPhones!|Verizon and Sprint introduced the iPhone in February and October of 2011, respectively. Prior to launching the iPhone, both carriers had to promote the Android platform heavily as an alternative. As a result, the iPhone has never achieved the dominant position it enjoys at AT&T with Verizon or Sprint. As of last quarter, iPhone sales made up 51% of the total at Verizon, and around 28% of the total at Sprint.|Foolish bottom lineWhile the iPhone has a minuscule market share at T-Mobile so far, that has more to do with the late launch than anything specific to T-Mobile. Even if the iPhone's "ceiling" at T-Mobile is lower than at AT&T or Verizon, there is still plenty of upside compared to its relatively low share in the last two quarters.|T-Mobile has been making major strides. Once they are able to get a hold of lower frequency spectrum, which will allow their towers to go 7-12x as far as they currently do with their higher frequency spectrum, then they'll be able to challenge VZ and AT&T. Until then, they seem to be smart enough to build out only in dense areas where they can continue to profit.|AT&T actually lost post-paid/contract subscribers in the past couple of quarters (has only been able to gain subscribers due to prepaid plans)|Everyone keeps talking about these cheaper Android phones. The Galaxy S series is the best selling phone series next to the iPhone. It's not cheap. The HTC One isn't cheap. The Sony Xperia Z isn't cheap. I see more lower income people with AT&T than I do T-Mobile but I know more high income people ($250,000 a year plus) who have T-Mobile. I'm a wise investor. I could either put my money in AT&T and pay over $300 a month or I can pay T-Mobile $170 a month for unlimited everything. It's a poor business decision to pay over $1000 a year for lesser service.

Although the company's third-quarter earnings results were strong, this wasn't enough to impress investors. How did this performance compare to that of competitors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) ? Will the company continue to grow in the fourth quarter? Let's analyze these issues.|Although the price of oil rose by 15% during the quarter, the company's realized price of oil increased by only 1.4%. This was also the case for Exxon and Chevron. Exxon's realized oil price grew by 5.6%; Chevron's by 7%. Moreover, these companies' revenues remained near-stagnant in the third quarter: Chevron's revenues inched up by 0.2%; Exxon's revenues slipped by 2.4%. Chevron's modest rise in revenues was due to adverse impact from currency changes, declines in asset sales, and little progress in downstream revenues. For Exxon, the sharp drop in downstream sales was among the main reasons for the decline in sales. Thus, in terms of growth in sales, Chesapeake has outperformed its competitors.|Chesapeake's valuation remains stableDespite Chesapeake's improvement, its valuation remains lower than its competitors. In the table below are the calculated enterprise value and EV-to-EBITDA ratios of Chesapeake, Chevron, and Exxon.|As you can see,Chesapeake's EV-to-EBITDA ratio is still higher than the industry average but remains lower than the ratio of Exxon or Chevron.

Without an obvious cause, most traders blamed the declines on the lingering fears of what the Federal Reserve could do to hurt the stock market's impressive bull run this year. In the absence of major macroeconomic news, stocks fell largely due to individual-company issues, and Disney (NYSE: DIS) , DuPont (NYSE: DD) , and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) are all among today's decliners.|DuPont has fallen 1.3% even though the company said it would work with energy specialist Navitas Systems to look at various safety solutions to try to prevent fires caused by lithium batteries. Given the number of high-profile incidents involving battery systems catching fire under certain circumstances, coming up with a solution could be a profitable niche for DuPont. Yet the bigger question is whether the venture will produce the high margins DuPont has sought lately, and if it won't, it could easily end up being part of what the chemical company chooses to jettison in its quest to concentrate more on the areas with the biggest profit potential.|We believe the last ten points of DuPont's rise this summer past is the Peltz bump. The bump occurred as investors piled in thinking that activist Nelson Peltz might bring some long-awaited relief and permanent reformation to this very sick Delaware-based conglomerate. But the commercial reality is little has changed. The first response of Ellen Kullman, DuPont Chieftess, to the disclosure Peltz had taken a substantial stake in her fiefdom was to lard herself with a potential going-away gift of $50 million via the insouciant DuPont Board of Directors she dominates as "Chair". Worse yet, she jiggers the bylaws and pops a nasty poison pill into the gut of this struggling conglomerate to repulse any takeover that might release value.

"Ordering restitution to Goldman Sachs for the cost of unwinding the defendant's position would make Goldman Sachs whole."|They said Taylor's conduct was the "plainly aberrant" act of a then 28-year-old trader under "overwhelming" pressure at Goldman to succeed, and that the risk of his committing similar conduct again is nonexistent.|"However misguided, his intentions were never to harm Goldman," Thomas Rotko, a partner at Clayman & Rosenberg, wrote, referring to Taylor.

Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Merck looks to animal healthOne big national ruling set the table for today's slide, as investors have grown wary of the U.S. economy's progress. A federal judge ruled that the city of Detroit's bankruptcy case can move into the restructuring phase, upsetting opposition and giving an excuse for investors looking to take profits before any hiccup in the Dow's year-to-date run. While Detroit's fate won't likely affect your top stocks much, it's a cautionary sign that some parts of the U.S. haven't felt the recovery's effects -- and Detroit-based carmakers, such as Ford, took a hit today in light of the news.|Merck was down as the company's rumored to be one of a handful of firms interested in a potential acquisition of rival Novartis' (NYSE: NVS) animal health division. Animal health's become a big draw in health care lately, and Merck boasts one of the top units in its own animal health business. Merck's unit currently ranks as the second largest animal health division in the industry, although the company's wrangled with potentially spinning off the business in recent months.|It's a similar path to what Pfizer took with its own animal health business, Zoetis. Pfizer's refocused on making branded pharmaceutical drugs, cutting out unrelated businesses like Zoetis to hone all of its assets on what it does best. It's served Pfizer well so far, and Merck, which has been slammed by pressures from the patent cliff, could use a financial boost from the potential sale or spinoff of its own unit.|On the other hand, gobbling up Novartis' animal health business could poise Merck as the dominant force in animal health, if the company's looking to become more diversified as it moves forward. However, other firms, such as Bayer (NASDAQOTH: BAYRY) , also are vying for Novartis' business, meaning that Merck investors should keep a close eye on whether Merck will bid too much for this potential buy.

Merck's stock has done well despite its falling sales, with shares gaining more than 21% year to date -- although Merck has found itself in the bottom half of the Dow's members in 2013. While investors haven't been disappointed by this stock's gains, can Merck perform even better next year?|The worst is over for SingulairStep one for Merck will be slowing down how quickly the company is losing sales due to patent expirations on top drugs. That should be the easy part: Former top-seller Singulair, which lost patent protection last year, has been largely responsible for Merck's declining financials this year. Singulair has lost around 74% of its sales year over year through the first nine months of 2013, putting a big dent in the growth from some of Merck's other drugs.|Fortunately, Singulair won't be such a singularly destructive force next year, as the biggest blows have been dealt. That's one bit of good news for Merck investors going into 2014, but the company also needs to keep its drugs currently on the market rolling along. Top diabetes-fighting drugs Januvia and Janumet are two huge keys to the future of this company's success, but Januvia in particular has underperformed this year. Still, the long-term prognosis for the drug is good: After all, diabetes is raging across the world in a global epidemic, becoming more prevalent in many large nations, including India and China. According to the American Diabetes Association, the United States alone had more than 25 million people with diabetes in 2011.|That's a big market for Januvia and Janumet to capitalize on, but it won't come all at once. Merck will need to reinvigorate these drugs' growth, and don't be surprised if sales growth for either of the drugs next year is slim -- or nonexistent.|Merck also needs to keep some of its other top drugs moving forward. Investors can count on immunology star Remicade continuing to pick up the slack at the company: Remicade has superstar status at rival pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and Merck receives some of its sales. Johnson & Johnson has made a killing off the drug, which grew sales at 7% through the first nine months of the year -- impressive for a therapy that sold nearly $5 billion over that time. Merck only made around a third of what Johnson & Johnson did over that time with its sales of Remicade, but it has also seen revenues grow, and this should only continue into 2014.|Looking into the pipelineMerck's pipeline will guide this company's long-term future, and fortunately for investors there's a big event coming up in the new year.|Osteoporosis therapy odanacatib, one of Merck's most promising developmental drugs, is set to be filed for regulatory approval sometime next year. Merck originally slated for the filing to happen in 2013, but a disappointing delay in February meant odanacatib will head off to regulators next year.|Another top drug under development is cancer therapy MK-3475, which investors need to keep an eye on as well. In November, MK-3475 showed off promising interim data in a clinical trial. This drug is currently in a phase 3 registration study, and some peak-sales estimates have pegged the drug at garnering up to $3 billion in annual revenue down the road. Watch for more announcements on this drug -- one of Merck's most important pipeline stars -- in the coming year.|A turnaround year for Merck's top lineOverall, 2014 will be a bounce-back year for Merck -- even though its stock has soared this year. Merck's sales have a great opportunity to recover from 2013's bloodbath considering Singular already has suffered the worst of its patent-cliff demolition. If Januvia and Janumet can get back on track -- or if Merck's other top drugs can churn out respectable growth -- this company will be ready to keep its stock and finances heading in the right direction.|But in the long term, it's Merck's pipeline that deserves attention. The company's research and development division has been criticized in the past for its costliness and underperformance, and while Merck is shaking up that segment of its business, it's time to see just whether or not pipeline stars like odanacatib can come through.|The market opportunity you can't miss in 2014Merck's facing a pivotal year in 2014, but is it the best stock for your money in the new year? The market stormed out to huge gains across 2013, leaving investors on the sidelines burned. However, opportunistic investors can still find huge winners.

With big players like Merck, Gilead Sciences, and several other major pharma and biotech players on its customer list, Veeva shares soared on its opening day. Given the increasing need for health-care companies to track more of their operations electronically, the IT company seems poised on the precipice of capturing a huge growth opportunity, thanks largely to its partnership with salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) .|Veeva Systems wasn't the first cloud-based company to take advantage of the favorable environment for IPOs, with several other players vaulting onto the public exchanges over the summer and fall months. But Veeva has ambitious plans, hoping to dislodge Oracle to provide a more customized cloud-based solution tailored specifically for the needs of life-sciences companies like Merck and Gilead Sciences. CEO Peter Gassner, a former employee at Salesforce, has said he believes the company's agility will allow it to play David to Oracle's Goliath, but can Veeva live up to the IPO hype? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Veeva Systems over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|In particular, Veeva could gain from big pharma's attempts to scale down its expenses. Merck and Gilead are both highly profitable, but they're also always on the lookout for ways to cut costs and divert more of their capital toward research and development. If Veeva's products can reduce overhead involved in handling relationships between drug salespeople and doctors and hospitals, Merck, Gilead, and other customers could boost their own profits while supporting Veeva's business.

In fact, Sarofim hates selling so much that he often owns the same stocks for decades. Such is the case for Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , Altria (NYSE: MO) , and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) -- all three have resided in the billionaire investor's portfolio for over a decade and will likely remain in his portfolio for decades to come -- and for good reason.|"Marlboro Friday" didn't keep him out of Philip Morris and AltriaMarlboro Friday -- the day in 1993 when Philip Morris, now Altria (NYSE: MO) and Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) , slashed the price of Marlboro cigarettes due to competition from private labels -- caused Sarofim's portfolio of brand names to crater. The shocking announcement caused many investors to question the value of consumer brands; if Marlboro could not command a premium over generics, then how could Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble? But the even-keeled Sarofim held firm in his conviction in brand names and continued to buy America's best brands, even as other investors dumped them.|Procter & GambleProcter & Gamble is another of Sarofim's favorite blue chips. Buffett also owns the consumer products conglomerate, but has sold about half of his 100 million share stake since late 2008. For a guy who likes consumer brands, Procter & Gamble is a must-have. The company is a hodgepodge of America's most valuable brands; its brands range from Cover Girl cosmetics, to Charmin toilet paper, to Tide laundry detergent.|In addition to growing earnings Procter & Gamble reliably produces $0.13 in free cash flow for each dollar of sales. This makes the company's free cash flow relatively easy to predict -- which means the company is rarely cheap. The stock currently trades at a free cash flow yield of about 4%, not very attractive for most investors.|But, like Buffett, Sarofim wants to buy and hold forever. According to Morningstar, Procter & Gamble earns a 12.44% return on invested capital. The longer an investor owns the stock, the closer his or her return will be to the return on invested capital rather than the initial earnings yield.

It might not be as complicated as you think. Consider Warren Buffett, the folksy Midwesterner who also happens to be the most successful long-term investor in American history. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) , built a fortune buying and holding shares of great American companies like Heinz and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , among other brands you and I encounter on a daily basis.|While Buffett's investing abilities are extraordinary, his rationale for Heinz and Coca-Cola was quite elementary: He identified a deep connection between the product and customer, based primarily on taste. The science behind this unique attraction is complex, but it's also one of one of the simplest investment ideas I've ever come across.|What's in a Coke and a condiment?Any investor familiar with the Oracle of Omaha knows he has a soft spot for hamburgers and cherry Cokes, and he's not the only one. Hamburgers are about as American as apple pie (though no better for our waistlines), and a dab of Heinz ketchup and side of Coca-Cola improves the overall experience.|Buffett and Munger believe that time is on your side when you own a great business, but what is it that makes Heinz and Coca-Cola so compelling? Few specific brands have staying power of over a century, and we're talking about a vinegar-tomato concoction and coca-infused sugar water. Quite frankly, could these products be any easier to rip off?|Heinz's and Coke's secret sauceFor starters, Buffett's familiarity level with the food and beverage industry is higher than many investors realize. One of his first jobs as a young boy in Omaha was selling bottles of Coca-Cola door-to-door in his neighborhood. Since then, Buffett's dabbled in the food industry quite frequently throughout his investing career. Today, Berkshire has built a deep roster of familiar brands, including ownership stakes in Kraft Foods, Mondelez, See's Candies, and Dairy Queen in addition to Coke and Heinz.|As it turns out, Coca-Cola-brand sodas and Heinz ketchup have incredibly high levels of amplitude. Coke's close competitor, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) , also achieves high marks in this category. As taste expert Judy Heylmun pointed out to Gladwell, "The thing about Coke and Pepsi is that they are absolutely gorgeous. They have beautiful notes -- all flavors are in balance. It's very hard to do that well." In fact, very few cola competitors even come close, which is one reason that the top three colas in terms of American market share are Coke at 17%, Diet Coke at 9.4%, and Pepsi at 8.9%, according to Beverage Digest.|Coca-Cola's secret formula vault. Source: Coca-Cola Press Center.|My colleague Ted Cooper recently summarized Buffett's thesis on Coke as follows: "Buffett saw that Coca-Cola was an exportable brand. It is something that all people in all countries can enjoy and the company has a massive distribution network that can deliver the product to all parts of the world." My fellow Fool also points out that average consumption worldwide is one-fourth the rate of that in the top 10 markets for Coca-Cola. On paper, that's a vast untapped market for this sweet, fizzy beverage.|Fool contributor Isaac Pino, CPA, has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.|I should point out that the article is based on what I believe to be the most important aspect of Buffett's thesis for Coca Cola and Heinz, and not about whether the companies are a buy today. I think Munger's and Buffett's understanding of the appeal of Coke and Heinz ketchup to a wide audience served as the foundation for their investments. The recipe was key to an 'enduring economic moat' in the form of a difficult-to-replicate intangible asset. They realized what sold in America could sell around the world (even though some countries, like France, have banned ketchup ;), and I don't believe it can be simplified to selling a warm, fuzzy feeling created by the brands. Lots of products have brand loyalty (even Twinkies!) but the market share and margins driven by repeat consumption patterns are something witnessed by few other consumer goods companies. And, to be frank, it's not simply the brand, because Coca-Cola's success in brand extension is limited to Diet Coke. Numerous other "Coke" products have come and gone over the years and ultimately failed. So, it's a lot more than just the brand and selling "happiness" in my opinion (although that top-of-mind characteristic helps enormously).

Sofosbuvir represents Gilead's greatest candidate for growth in the coming years, and should provide plenty of cash flows to support expansion of its up-and-coming oncology franchise. For Johnson & Johnson, this is yet another victory in the resurgence of its pharmaceutical division that has fueled growth in the last year, but the question is whether or not it can stack up against a slew of competition.|Oncology foesJohnson & Johnson and partner Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC) picked up another win on Nov. 13 when the FDA approved cancer drug Ibrutinib, now branded as Imbruvica. Imbruvica was approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, under expedited review with the FDA's new breakthrough therapy designation. Johnson & Johnson had earlier executed a wonderful deal, pitching $975 million to collaborate on development of a drug now estimated to bring in $6 billion at its peak.|The bottom lineOur virtual portfolio has done well thus far, while beating the S&P 500 by more than 12 percentage points. So far our investment theses remain in tact, with Gilead's growth story coming together, Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical revival in full swing, and Celgene's Revlimid anchoring the company's growth. By including these businesses in the virtual portfolio chances are good that we can see gains from both the large hepatitis C market and the oncology market, where advances continue to address unmet medical needs.|Even more dividend stocks to loveWe chose Johnson & Johnson because its stability and dividend are great assets to a portfolio. Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine. With this in mind, our analysts sat down to identify the absolute best of the best when it comes to rock-solid dividend stocks, drawing up a list in this free report of nine that fit the bill.

In addition to specific proprietary factors, Trade-Ideas identified Merck as such a stock due to the following factors:|Merck & Co., Inc. provides various health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health, and consumer care products worldwide. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 3.5%. MRK has a PE ratio of 33.4. Currently there are 5 analysts that rate Merck a buy, 1 analyst rates it a sell, and 8 rate it a hold.|The average volume for Merck has been 14.5 million shares per day over the past 30 days. Merck has a market cap of $145.6 billion and is part of the health care sector and drugs industry. The stock has a beta of 0.52 and a short float of 0.9% with 2.09 days to cover. Shares are up 21.7% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Friday.|TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Merck as a buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and increase in stock price during the past year. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.

Recent stumbles have Merck struggling to offset the sting of generic competition on some of its best-selling drugs.|The win may come in the form of MK-3475, a potential blockbuster treatment for advanced melanoma. The Food and Drug Administration gave MK-3475 breakthrough therapy designation based on prior phase 1b success. If MK-3475 succeeds in a phase 3 faceoff with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) Yervoy, Merck could end up with a game-changing drug.|Conducting a flurry of studiesMerck is treating 3,000 patients with MK-3475 across eight different studies. The size of Merck's MK-3475 program hints at its expectations and early results suggest the drug may prove a powerful weapon in battling tough to treat melanoma.|Results from the MK-3475 versus Yervoy trial should be available as early as next summer. But, MK-3475 has other cancer in its sights too. In one, Merck's study for non-small-cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, it's matched up against a combination therapy that includes Eli Lilly's (NYSE: LLY) Alimta. Alimta contributed sales of $189 million to Lilly through the first nine months of this year. Another study compares MK-3475 against a cocktail including Sanofi's former cancer blockbuster Taxotere in NSCLC. Prior to losing patent protection back in 2011, Sanofi made $3 billion a year from that drug.|Another study takes on one of Merck's own drugs, Temodar. That drug, approved in 1999, lost patent protection this year after generating $917 million in global sales for Merck in 2012. This past summer, generic manufacturers Teva Pharmaceutical and Perrigo teamed up to launch their own version of Temodor. The Teva and Perrigo threat has Merck angling to prove MK-3475's superiority, because if it can, it may insulate the company from losing ground to the new generics.|The money at stake for Merck and Bristol-Myers is big given Yervoy's sales run rate makes it a blockbuster. Yervoy could become Bristol's biggest seller by 2016, thanks not only to a big patient pool, but a price tag of roughly $120,000 for a four-dose course of treatment.|Foolishly final thoughtsThe ability of Merck's MK-3475 to shrink tumors in 52% of patients matches up almost identically with results from combining Bristol-Myers' Yervoy and Nivolumab, according to results presented in the New England Journal of Medicine.|Merck will need to maintain at least equal footing with Yervoy through trials if it hopes to win away Yervoy's market share. If MK-3475 remains successful through clinic, its single drug dosing may prove a significant advantage over a two drug Yervoy and Nivolumab combination. That suggests MK-3475 may have pricing power at least equal to Yervoy and a much-needed blockbuster.

Grainger (NYSE: GWW) , Nike (NYSE: NKE) and VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) :|Nike|In the case of Grainger, an investor netted an extra 34.2% over the course of five years simply by reinvesting all dividends paid by the company. In the second example, an investor gained an extra 26.5% by reinvesting all dividends paid by Nike. Finally, just by reinvesting all dividends paid by VF Corp over the last five years, investors gained an additional 72.8%.|Grainger, Nike and VF Corp are prime examples because in addition to offering solid yields and increasing dividends, the companies are all growing revenue and earnings per share well. This subsequently enhances share appreciation and makes each dividend reinvestment more valuable.

Those companies should have global leading positions in the industry, a decent dividend yield, and a reasonable payout ratio. Here are the three world-class consumer goods companies that fit all those criteria above: Unilever (NYSE: UL) , Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) .|Procter & Gamble will generate higher profits with its cost savings programProcter & Gamble is another global consumer goods giant that investors should keep for their long-term income portfolios. Under the leadership of returning CEO A.G. Lafley, Procter & Gamble expected to improve its profitability through its ongoing $10 billion cost savings program. The program comprises $2 billion in operating leverage, $6 billion in COGS, and another $2 billion in overhead savings. The company has consolidated several factories in developed markets such as Western Europe and the U.S., while also reducing 7,000 office jobs around the world.|Procter & Gamble is trading at $85.40 per share with a total market capitalization of $232.20 billion. With a similar payout ratio to Unilever, Procter & Gamble also offers investors sustainable dividends but with a lower yield at 2.80%. More cash will be returned to Procter & Gamble's shareholders with its ongoing share repurchase. The company plans to buy back around $5-$7 billion in fiscal 2014.|My Foolish takeThese global consumer goods businesses could fit well into the income portfolios of long-term investors. With a decent dividend yield, a reasonable payout ratio, and ongoing share buybacks, investors can sleep well when investing in these three companies. Moreover, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, and Kimberly-Clark could drive their profitability higher in the long run with their ongoing business restructuring initiatives and expansions.|More rock-solid dividend stocks like Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-ClarkDividend stocks can make you rich.

Earlier last week RBC Capital initiated coverage on Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) with a "sector perform" rating and a price target of $91, implying about 8% upside from its Friday close. I would personally say there's nothing particularly exciting about RBC's coverage initiation or price target, and that this would speak to Procter & Gamble's steady and almost boring business model.

While the iPad Air 16GB, iPad mini 16GB and iPad Air 32GB models were the top three products at Target, the iPad mini 16GB was the hottest-selling product at Wal-Mart.|The only other popular tablet at Wal-Mart (both online and retail) was the RCA Android, which was well behind in seventh position. This is particularly encouraging since Apple has not offered any discounts this year. The other big positive for Apple (and concern for Android) was the fact that roughly 40% of these tablets were bought by Android smartphone users.

Brawls broke out at Wal-Mart -- which seems to be de rigueur for the season now -- and cops shot a shoplifter at Kohl's. Thieves also shot a shopper carrying home a TV he'd just purchased at Target (NYSE: TGT) .

The NRF says this will be the 10th consecutive year that Black Friday is the biggest shopping day of the year, despite sales falling two years in a row now, but some 80% of shoppers plan on spending less overall this holiday. Still, Wal-Mart said it sold 2 million TVs on Black Friday, as well as 1.4 million tablets.|Yet obviously as retailers extend discounts earlier and earlier into the month, the outsize role Black Friday has played will diminish over time.

But you're well within the bounds of sane logic and human decency if you take a shot at the cats who serve as spokespeople for America's dumpiest retailer, not to mention upper management.|They're collectively culpable not only for making retail such a crappy job in so many corners of the country, but contributing to the degradation of certain segments of society.

The Wal-Mart response should not seek to exonerate itself from the epidemic it has a five-fingered hand in triggering; it should denounce it and then actually do something about it.|At this point, however, there's probably no hope for Wal-Mart.

However, hope springs eternal for Apple(AAPL).|In the process, Cook should call it like it is by saying what nobody at Wal-Mart has the guts to say.|How can we ignore one human being trampling over another or the cops needing to step in to restrain people and restore order just to sell product?

Heck, in one YouTube, a retail employee was obviously instructed to tell the taper to press stop.

Moreover, the iPad Mini was eligible for Wal-Mart's 1-Hour In Stock Guarantee, meaning that anyone who was in a Wal-Mart store by 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving was guaranteed the promotional price for the iPad Mini.|Not surprisingly, the $100 gift card was a big enticement. Wal-Mart stores sold 1.4 million tablets on Thanksgiving, and the company specifically called out the iPad Mini as a top seller. A survey by InfoScout found that the iPad Mini was by far the top item at Wal-Mart, and was more than four times as popular as the next two tablets combined!

The third major credit card giant, American Express (NYSE: AXP) , seems to get overlooked by many investors as a result.|While the company offers slower growth compared to MasterCard and Visa, American Express excels in other areas and in many ways is the safer growth alternative. As such, American Express remains an excellent choice for investors seeking to capitalize on the strong industry trends while avoiding much of the risk.|American Express|As expected, American Express lags significantly behind MasterCard and Visa in terms of revenue and EPS growth. However, this is reflected in the cheap valuation multiples of American Express compared to its competitors.|In addition to having the highest yield of all three companies, American Express also generates the most revenue by far, despite being the smallest company in the group. Impressively, American Express is expected to generate more than twice the revenue of Visa and more than three times the revenue of MasterCard in 2014.|A slightly different businessAmerican Express has a strong brand image, perhaps the strongest out of all of the major credit card companies. This is largely because the cards issued by the company have traditionally been geared toward a wealthier clientele.|American Express and investors stand to benefit from this in several ways. The company's business can be seen as relatively dependable as wealthier consumers are often less vulnerable to short-term economic volatility. American Express customers are often very loyal as well. As Warren Buffet famously said of the company's brand, it is "synonymous with financial integrity and money substitutes around the world." A loyal customer base translates into repeat business opportunities for American Express, which only adds more stability to the company's revenue stream.|Outside of brand image and clientele, another benefit is that the traditionally tight focus of American Express' business means that there are now significant opportunities for the company to regain business that was previously lost to competitors.|In addition to growing through acquisition, American Express is also busy honing the focus of its businesses. The company recently reached an agreement with Time to sell its publishing unit, American Express Publishing. While this unit only accounted for a small portion of the company's total revenue, when combined with similar moves made by management in recent years it illustrates just how intent management is on focusing American Express' business mix. A tighter business often means a more efficient business, and this gradual transition by management should benefit the company and investors in the long-term.|Lower riskWhile American Express offers investors less growth overall compared to competitors, it also offers investors significantly less risk. With a higher yield and much cheaper valuation multiples, American Express is a great way for investors to capitalize on the strong growth in plastic without buying the industry's two high-flying superstars.

Just one of its airplane models, the ubiquitous 737, has carried more than 16.8 billion passengers over its lifetime -- more than twice the population of the globe. So chances are, if you're breathing today, you've probably flown on a Boeing.|Yet as familiar as the Boeing brand is to us, there's still a lot about the company that a lot of people don't know. Here are just a few of those things.|1. Look up in the air! That's not Superman. That's a Boeing 737!Take that 737, for example. You've probably heard that it's the "best-selling commercial aircraft in aviation history," right? More than 11,500 orders placed? More than 7,700 planes delivered?|What you may not know is what those numbers mean in practice. As a result of its immense sales success, there are now so many 737s in service around the globe that, on average, a 737 airplane takes off or lands somewhere around the globe once every two seconds. And any given moment, 2,000 of Boeing's 737 workhorses are probably airborne.|So yes, if you "look! Up in the sky!" -- chances are that thing you see with the sunlight glinting off it is neither a bird, nor a Superman, but a Boeing 737. Take that, EADS (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) !|2. Boeing's older than your grandfather -- and richer, tooImpressive as this sounds, it's actually old hat for Boeing. It's been 110 years since Orville and Wilbur Wright took their first powered air flight in Kill Devil Hills, N.C. But within just 13 years of the Wright Brothers' invention of the airplane, Boeing had invented the airplane company.|Founded by William E. Boeing in 1916 in Seattle, Boeing today employs roughly 175,000 people and has a presence in nearly half the countries on the globe. It sells $85 billion worth of merchandise annually, and while its 7.6% operating profit margin isn't the best in the business (that honor goes to Brazilian planemaker Embraer (NYSE: ERJ) ), Boeing is 73% more profitable than archrival Airbus.|3. Boeing's come a long way (baby)How did Boeing get so big, and so good at what it does? In part because the company's a high-tech wonder. We tend to take airplanes for granted. But did you ever wonder how they get made -- or where they get made?|Seventy-five percent of the commercial aircraft in use today were built by Boeing. Statistically speaking, most of the airplanes you've ever flown on probably got put together at Boeing's Everett Factory, just north of Seattle. By volume, Boeing's Everett factory is the largest building ever constructed. Bigger than the Pentagon. Bigger than the Mall of America. It's so big that at one point, Boeing's engineers were worried that clouds might form inside, near the ceiling. So they put in an air circulation system to prevent cloud formation. (How many companies have that problem?)|Meet the world's biggest building -- brought to you by Boeing. Source: Wikimedia Commons.|4. Planes in spaceEveryone knows that Boeing builds planes. But did you know its high-tech expertise goes all the way into space? It's true. In 1995, Boeing joined forces with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) to form the United Space Alliance, which helps NASA with space launch and recovery operations and mission planning and control, and it even trains astronauts for spaceflight. A decade later, Boeing and Lockheed integrated further by forming the United Launch Alliance, which performs space launches for the Department of Defense, NASA, and the National Reconnaissance Office.|Boeing "turned over the keys" of the International Space Station's on-orbit segment to NASA in 2010, but it still plays an integral role in integrating new components into the station.|5. A 21st-century technological wonder, with a workforce still living in the 1950sAt the same time as its technological achievements astound, in some ways Boeing is still a slave to tradition -- for example, in its employment practices. You've probably heard by now about some of the problems Boeing has been having with its labor unions. What you may not know, though, is that union negotiations and labor strikes are a problem fast becoming unique to Boeing.|According to The Wall Street Journal, 35% of American workers were members of one labor union or another back in the 1950s. Six decades later, that number's just 6.6% ... everywhere but at Boeing, where union membership soars to 39%. Twelve U.S. labor unions have Boeing workers on their rolls.|The two biggest players are the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers -- and Boeing literally cannot work without them. They comprise 13% and 21% of Boeing's workforce, respectively. And every five years or so, they begin new contract negotiations that threaten to bring the whole high-tech wonder that is Boeing to a screeching halt.

Heightened tensions in the region could mean even more arms sales for these defense contractors. The most immediate beneficiary of China's bellicosity, though, could be Boeing (NYSE: BA) .|It takes months to work out a major arms deal, after all. Years more to build and deliver the planes. By that time, tensions may have cooled, and the need for major arms purchases in Southeast Asia waned. In the meantime, though, China's rivals in the region must run extra air patrols to assert their territorial claims. Japan's patrols, challenged by China this week, included F-15 fighter jets and E-767 AWACS -- both manufactured by Boeing.|The more flight-hours these planes rack up over the East China Sea, the more maintenance work they'll require, and the more spare parts they'll need. When you consider that the cost of maintaining and servicing a warplane can exceed its initial purchase cost by a factor of three over its lifetime, a heightened tempo of air operations off China could mean an immediate increase in Boeing's revenue stream for servicing the planes it's already sold.|And if, on top of all this, Boeing also manages to ink a few more sales contracts for E-3 AWACS, F-15 fighter jets, and P-8 Poseidon surveillance craft?

Chevron has a low total debt to equity ratio of 0.13 and a healthy profit margin of 10.6%. It should not have any problem financing further Ukrainian development if exploratory drilling is successful.|Final thoughtsEnvironmental fears make fracking in the European Union a very challenging proposition. By focusing on Russia, ExxonMobil and BP have found a good way to increase their upstream volumes and gain access to reserves under the control of national oil companies. Chevron has the capital and knowledge to bring new shale resources online, and the Ukraine holds more promise than Poland thanks to its lack of European Union influence. Big oil needs growth, and Eastern Europe is very promising.

In many cases, it can take an experienced team more than a decade and a billion dollars before a new medication reaches the market. That may surprise you, but take a peek at how much today's biggest pharmaceutical companies are spending on research and development every quarter. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) plowed $1.6 billion, or 13% of its revenue, into R&D in the third quarter of this year, while Merck devoted slightly more to its development efforts. These companies and their shareholders naturally hope that some of the experimental compounds in their pipelines will get FDA approval and eventually join the billion-dollar "blockbuster drug" club, but there are no guarantees that this will happen. The human body can be a mystery, and research programs don't always work out as planned.|While failure in clinical trials can spell disaster for drug developers, some of the most groundbreaking medications were discovered entirely by accident. You may already be familiar with some prominent examples, such as the story behind Alexander Fleming's discovery of Penicillin, but let's look at three more obscure instances of random drug discovery that have helped thousands of patients and been a boon to drugmakers like Pfizer and Allergan (NYSE: AGN) in recent years.|Little blue pill, humungous profitsMore than 20 years ago, scientists at Pfizer had designed a small molecule, called UK-92480, to treat various heart conditions, like high blood pressure and angina. In early clinical trials, the chances that this drug would become an effective cardiac treatment looked slim, but clinicians did notice an unexpected side-effect in male patients ... a, well, very pleasant side-effect.|Pfizer quickly realized this drug was more potent at aiding blood flow in one particular part of the body, and its commercial potential as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, or ED, soon became clear. Under the brand name Viagra, this became the first orally administered treatment for this indication. Viagra hit U.S. pharmacies in 1998, and sales exceeded a billion dollars in its first full year on the market. The product continues to be a key sales driver for Pfizer and brought in $945 billion in the first half of this year alone.|The discovery of Viagra undoubtedly helped thousands of patients and made a direct impact on Pfizer's top line, but some may not realize that it also created a completely new market opportunity for other drugmakers. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) , for instance, sells a rival ED drug called Cialis, and it's currently the company's fourth best-selling product. It took in more than a billion dollars in the first half of 2013, and it's helped prop up Lilly's revenue as it deals with generic competition for fading blockbusters such as Zyprexa. VIVUS (NASDAQ: VVUS) is another company entering this lucrative market. This biotech is known more for its obesity medication Qsymia, but it recently inked a partnership agreement with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals for its ED drug Stendra. The deal could be worth $300 million if all milestones are met, and while the drug's efficacy could attract some patients, it has to go up against Pfizer and Eli Lilly's massive marketing teams. It will also have to face cheap generics when Viagra and Cialis lose exclusivity in a few years.

But Buffett saw a company that was on the verge of massive shareholder creation -- even more than had occurred in the past.|Coca-Cola went on to become one of Buffett's greatest investments. Moreover, the conditions that made Coca-Cola a great investment in the late 1980s still exist today -- making it a potentially great investment for the current generation.|Two keys to Buffett's investment in Coca-ColaIn 1988, Coca-Cola had two key attributes that made it an appealing investment: pricing power and untapped growth. The pricing power should have been obvious to anyone. Brand loyalty enables Coca-Cola to raise prices without worrying about a sharp drop-off in sales volume.|For the most part, people who drink Coke only drink Coke; Coke drinkers will not drink a Pepsi just because it is a dime cheaper. The same is true for many of Coca-Cola's brands -- then and now. This is an invaluable trait that few companies have -- but that most of Buffett's investments have. Pricing power creates value for shareholders like no other.|Investors, then and now, could be forgiven for not seeing the second attribute that makes Coca-Cola a wonderful long-term investment. Let's see if you can spot it. Look at the chart below; look at the black bars (per capita Coke consumption in 1992) and then look at the green bars (per capita consumption in 2012). What would make Buffett think Coca-Cola had significant untapped growth?|Source: Coca-Cola|Here's my guess: Buffett saw that Coca-Cola was an exportable brand. It is something that all people in all countries can enjoy and the company has a massive distribution network that can deliver the product to all parts of the world.|I am not so sure that I would have seen Coca-Cola's opportunity in 1988, but I can see it now. Mexico, Chile, Panama, and the United States: these are not the most culturally similar places on the globe, yet the citizens of each country drink gobs of Coca-Cola's beverages each year. Other countries in the top 10 include Spain, Bolivia, and South Africa.|Coca-Cola truly is a global brand -- which is why its growth opportunity is as big today as it was in 1988. The top 10 Coke-consuming countries drink 386 servings of Coca-Cola beverages per person per year. By comparison, the worldwide average consumption rate is only 94 servings per person per year.|There is no reason -- cultural or economic -- that the rest of the world should not one day drink as much Coke as the top 10 countries. As Coca-Cola expands its reach and exports its brand to all corners of the globe, the consumption gap between the top 10 countries and the rest of the world will narrow. Fortunately for long-term investors, the rest of the world will drink a lot more Coke before it catches up.|PepsiCo would have been a good investment tooIf you compare the price history of Coca-Cola to that of PepsiCo, you will notice that it did not really matter whether Buffett purchased Coca-Cola or PepsiCo. Both businesses benefit from the ability to raise prices and export their brands around the globe.|Though PepsiCo may be a distant second in the cola wars, its wide moat Frito Lay division gives it something that Coca-Cola does not have: diversification. If past trends are any indication, far more carbonated soft drinks will be consumed in 20 years than are consumed today. But in the short run, declining soft drink consumption in the United States puts a lid on Coca-Cola's growth.|On the other hand, Frito Lay -- the largest salty snacks company in the world -- offers PepsiCo the same global dominance as Coca-Cola without the baggage tied to soft drinks.|Regardless, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are poised for another two decades of incredible growth.

Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $258.9 billion and in 2013 it brought in revenue of $469.2 billion. However in recent years the most interesting retailer has been none other than Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) . Over the past 10 years, Costco has grown its revenue by 118.6% while Wal-Mart has experienced barely half that growth. This should serve as a testament to both its size and management's ability to make intelligent decisions, but there is one downside to its pace of growth; small margins.|In the table above, we can see the net profit margins of Costco, Wal-Mart, and Target (NYSE: TGT) . Though none of the retailers above have what would normally be called wonderful margins, there's a clear difference between Costco and the rest of the pack. What this likely means is that, for several years, Costco has been willing to take a much smaller profit on its sales in an attempt to boost growth, a strategy known as cost leadership. By doing so, a company hopes to achieve long-term growth and market share by foregoing short-term profit today.|In the graph above, we can see the impact that the company's low margin has had on its return on equity. In every year (except for 2013), Costco lagged both Wal-Mart and Target using this measure. However, we can also see that the company is gradually improving, rising from a return on equity of 10.9% in 2009 to 18.8% in 2013.|To account for these differences, I factored out both the long-term debt and tax-adjusted interest expenses of Wal-Mart, Costco and Target in the graph below:|Target's return was significantly affected by debt. Wal-Mart's return was inflated as well, but not anywhere near that of Target. Meanwhile, Costco saw hardly any change in its return on equity due to debt assumption, with the exception of 2013 when the company increased its debt load from $1.38 billion to $5 billion.|Foolish takeawayUsing the data compiled above, we can more effectively evaluate the value given to investors who buy up a piece of these companies. It is true that Costco experienced a lower return on equity than its peers over the previous five years, but the Foolish investor should keep in mind that the returns gained by both Target and Wal-Mart carried greater risk should business falter. When you consider that Costco is seeing its return on equity rise every year, irrespective of its debt load, then the company's position looks quite clear.|To make things even better, Costco has the lowest long-term debt/equity ratio of the three at 0.46 (compared to 0.54 and 0.89 for Wal-Mart and Target, respectively), which means that it has the capacity to pump up its future returns with the assumption of greater debt should it choose. So, what's the verdict after all this? While the future isn't always certain, it appears as though Costco's decision to forego higher margins now is paying off. It cannot be guaranteed that this will continue into perpetuity, but I think it would be wrong to say that the company's situation is pointing to a downturn anytime soon.

The company's consecutive dividend streak started back in 1975, and the current payout is $1.88. That gives it a yield of 2.4% -- enough to rank Wal-Mart among the 18 highest-yielding Dow components, but still slightly below the Dow's average yield of 2.68%.|The pastWal-Mart paid its first quarterly dividend on March 13, 1974. Adjusted for splits, that payout now amounts to $0.0001. The following year, the payout got cut to a split-adjusted $0.00006. But since then, the dividend has only gone up, and it now sits at a whopping $0.47 per share. That's an increase of 783,233% over the past 38 years! Just since 1985, it's up more than 27,000%. Take a look.|No matter how you look at it, Wal-Mart has been an absolutely amazing investment for those who bought shares and held on for the long run.|The futureOf course, knowing how great of an investment Wal-Mart has been in the past doesn't really help investors who may be thinking about buying shares today. So what's the future look like for the company? Well, consider that Wal-Mart was able to take the entire retail Main Street experience -- hardware store, sporting-goods shop, clothier, bakery, grocer -- and put them under one roof. It changed the way we shop. It made shopping cheaper and more convenient. Buying in bulk from suppliers meant Wal-Mart got discounts it could pass along to consumers. Building more locations and larger stores helped reduce costs even further, as more products and higher volumes moved through each location. In short, the synergies from one-stop shopping lowered operating costs.|How does that help in the future? Because taking those same principles that have worked so well in the U.S. and applying them around the world will allow Wal-Mart and its shareholders to continue to experience massive returns for years to come. For example, in India, the world's second most populated country, Wal-Mart has hardly even scratched the surface. Locations in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, as well as further development in South America, still present big opportunities for the company. While each region of the world will certainly bring its own challenges, Wal-Mart's basic concept of a convenient one-stop shop with the cheapest prices is a formula for success no matter what country you're in.|However, as I've mentioned before with Wal-Mart, this company isn't likely to be quite as much of a highflier in the coming years. Wal-Mart is a mature and stable company, and investors shouldn't expect the kind of massive returns the stock has yielded over the past 38 years. Growth will still come -- just not at the rate it came in the past.

The company's constant innovation has cemented its strong industry position, which in turn has helped it successfully ward off competitors and remain the world's most dominate athletic brand.|Not surprisingly, investors along for the ride have benefited immensely. Shares of Nike are up approximately 200% in the last five years, and over 50% in 2013 alone. The best part is that the company's above-average returns are likely to continue long into the future.|What's driving Nike's growth?The main reason for Nike's appreciation has been the company's reliable revenue and earnings-per-share growth. This is derived directly from the brand's ability to innovate traditional product categories and create entirely new ones.|Despite already controlling large amounts of the athletic footwear and apparel markets, management at Nike is still trying to innovate in each space. In Nike's most recent earnings release, President and CEO Mark Parker stated, "Our ability to innovate, it's what drives our growth and it always starts with the athlete."|Parker then began to explain the myriad of new product offerings the company was set to introduce. These include the new Nike Free Flyknit running shoe, the Hypervenom football boot, and various additions to the Dri-Fit apparel product line. The ability to expand existing product lineups and venture into new ones is of course only made possible by the strength in Nike's core businesses.|On that front, Nike is doing quite well. Nike brand revenue was up 7% in the most recent quarter, highlighted by strength in the company's direct-to-consumer and online businesses. Nike's essential North American business also performed admirably, growing revenue an impressive 9%. This was driven primarily by growth in the segment's basketball and running categories.|The new product introductions and continued strength in Nike's core businesses is translating into sustained and robust growth. The following is a breakdown of Nike's projected growth rate compared to competitors Under Armour (NYSE: UA) and VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) :|Nike|The data above indicates that Nike is growing admirably compared to its competitors. Although the company's revenue and EPS growth is expected to be notably slower than that of the younger and smaller Under Armour, Nike's growth is projected to be more robust than that of VF Corp, a solid growth company in its own right.|Additionally, Nike's growth does not come at too steep a price for investors as the company's valuation multiples currently appear attractive. Nike's forward P/E of 22.29 is significantly lower than Under Armour's forward P/E of 44.92 and only slightly higher than VF Corp's forward P/E of 18.94.|Impressive dividend growthNike currently pays an annual dividend of $0.96, which equates to a yield of 1.20%. The company has excelled at raising dividends in recent years, and this was perfectly demonstrated last week when management announced that it was raising Nike's quarterly dividend to $0.26 from $0.21. This represents an increase of 14%.|This most recent increase follows in a long line of dividend raises from Nike over the last decade. The following is a breakdown of the company's impressive dividend history:|Nike|Over the last decade, management at Nike has raised the company's dividend every year at rather substantial rates. Despite rapid stock appreciation, the company's yield has also remained close to the 1.5% threshold.|Not only does Nike's solid dividend history mean that investors can expect dividend raises every year from the company, it also means that a cut to Nike's dividend is extremely unlikely.|Share buyback programAlthough it was announced almost a year ago, Nike's share buyback program deserves to be mentioned here because it is so massive in scale and has only just begun to take effect.|This program followed closely on the heels of Nike's previous $5 billion share repurchase program which was announced in 2008. The pattern now demonstrates that management is dedicated to further increasing shareholder value through share buybacks. It also means that future repurchase programs are likely to happen after the current one ends.|Just do it!Nike is a relatively mature company, but it is one that is aging very gracefully. Although the company's revenue growth has understandably slowed from its days of early expansion, management is still finding ways to significantly expand the company's reach and grow sales and earnings in the process.

The largest nine positions account for 81% of the portfolio -- and Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart are three of those nine. As three of Buffett's top nine investments, each is an important stock for coattail investors to scrutinize.|The ubiquitous Procter & GambleProcter & Gamble's brands range from laundry detergent to cosmetics to pet food, but the origin of Buffett's stake in the company is an un-diversified razor-blade company called Gillette. Buffett purchased shares of Gillette in 1989 and held onto the stock until it was acquired in 2005 by Procter & Gamble.|After Gillette was acquired in an all-stock deal, Buffett owned about 100 million shares of Procter & Gamble. Today, Buffett owns only 52 million shares. He started to reduce his stake in 2009 to raise cash for other investments -- eventually acquiring Burlington Northern Santa Fe, among other multi-billion-dollar investments, with the proceeds.|Despite Buffett having reduced his stake by half in the last five years, Procter & Gamble remains a 4.3% position in Berkshire's portfolio. The recession exposed Procter & Gamble's over-expansion during the boom years, which is probably to blame for Buffett's current lack of enthusiasm for the stock. But the company's strong portfolio of consumer brands should enable it to continue earning above-normal profits for decades to come.|Some of its best-known brands include Charmin, Cover Girl, Tide, and Iams -- each is a leading brand in its respective category. As a result, Procter & Gamble's earning power is at least as safe as Coca-Cola's.|Bottom lineCoca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart are not just three companies in a legendary investor's portfolio -- they are three companies that account for one-third of a legendary investor's best bets.

Back then, many investors were alarmed by Coca-Cola's declining earnings and feared that the company would lose market share in the years ahead. Of course, the iconic beverage company regained its composure and continues to dominate the industry to this day.|There are several reasons why Buffett still owns a 16.5% position in the company. For one, it has a stable and leading market share. This is evidence that Coca-Cola has been able to keep competitors at bay and keep earning out-sized profits.|The sources of Coca-Cola's market share stability are its unparalleled distribution network and its second-to-none brand portfolio. Distribution networks are difficult and expensive to build; only PepsiCo has anything close to Coca-Cola's distribution scale in the non-alcoholic beverage industry. As a result, Coca-Cola is able to get its products into more stores and on better terms than many of its smaller rivals.|Coca-Cola's brands include Coca-Cola, Minute Maid, Powerade, and other ubiquitous beverages. The consumer mind share that its brands have attained -- and their low prices relative to consumers' total grocery budgets -- allows Coca-Cola to raise prices and still attract a loyal following of consumers that will not settle for any other brand.

According to a 2011 article in Time magazine, "nearly 20 states and cities are now considering soda taxes, and a long list of international health organizations have called for reduced soda consumption."|The tobacco tax works in the same way, with proceeds from the tax going to fund anti-smoking campaigns and other government programs. It seems as though all levels of government have become addicted to raising excise taxes. According to Philip Morris, 55% of the sales price of a pack of Marlboro cigarettes goes into the pockets of federal, state, and local governments. A decade or two from now, the same tax may be due on a can of Coca-Cola.|Philip Morris diversified like PepsiCo, then undiversified like Coca-ColaAmid a growing list of states adding excise taxes on tobacco, Philip Morris began to diversify its operations through a string of acquisitions. In the 1980s, it acquired two companies that eventually became Kraft Foods. Altria, Philip Morris USA's parent company, has since spun off the Kraft Foods unit and again almost completely relies on the tobacco industry.|PepsiCo is in a position similar to that of Philip Morris in the 80's and 90's. The company has the second-largest share of the much-maligned soft drink market, behind only Coca-Cola. However, PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay, the largest salty snacks company in the world. According to Morningstar, Frito Lay has a 40% share of the global salty snacks market; it is essentially the Coca-Cola of snack foods. This provides PepsiCo with a wide-moat company that makes it less dependent on the uncertain soft drink industry -- not unlike Philip Morris's diversification with Kraft.|Coca-Cola, on the other hand, is completely at the mercy of sugary beverages. Even so, international unit case volume represented 81% of Coca-Cola's total unit case volume in 2012. The company's geographic diversification buys it some time because rhetoric against soft drinks is most heated in the United States. However, if the current direction of worldwide public opinion persists, Coca-Cola's core offering will soon be slapped with burdensome excise taxes.|Not all is lost, however, even if Coca-Cola refuses to expedite the diversification of its offering into healthier beverages. After spinning off its food division, Altria again relies on a hated product -- tobacco -- and it is as profitable as ever. Despite the harsh laws and regulation in the industry, Altria's market position enables it to earn a high-30s operating margin and a mid-to-high-teens return on invested capital, according to Morningstar data. The same could be true for Coca-Cola; the world market leader is in a much better position to handle burdensome taxation than its smaller competitors, possibly leading to increased market share and maintaining its profitability.|Bottom lineChanges are coming in the soft drink industry and they look a lot like the changes made to the tobacco industry many decades ago. The changes will hurt the soft drink industry overall -- and Coca-Cola would be wise to continue diversifying its line-up of drinks into healthier options -- but Altria's success in a heavily taxed industry suggests that Coca-Cola may not be in a such terrible position after all.

It is hard to lose money if you only buy stocks that meet all three criteria. Three stocks that currently meet those criteria are eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) , McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) , and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) .|PredictableWhen I say predictable, I mean a company that does the same thing year after year and gets the same results year after year. eBay facilitates online auctions and processes online payments, McDonald's serves fast food, and Coca-Cola sells carbonated soft drinks. Each company acquires other businesses and has unrelated operations from time to time, but the core of each company's operations remains the same. This sameness is vital to an investor's analysis; it would be impossible to gauge eBay's long-term earning power if it were constantly changing its business model. A consistent model with a long track record provides invaluable clues as to the potential of a business.|Another part of predictability is the tendency to earn the same level of profit per item sold each year. A company that generates a consistent profit margin each year is likely insulated from competition and has control over its prices. Over the last ten years, eBay, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola generated remarkably consistent free cash flow margins; none fluctuated more than 20% from the mean in most years -- extremely low rates of fluctuation.|Like McDonald's, Coca-Cola earns predictable profits due to its unmatched scale. It has a distribution network that no other competitor can replicate and a brand that consumers worldwide can identify. As with McDonald's, Coca-Cola's competitive advantages are too great for a rival carbonated-beverage company to overcome; the only plausible cause of declining profitability is a mass consumer migration away from carbonated soft drinks.|eBay, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola have competitive advantages that allow them to earn predictable profits each year. This makes it relatively easy to determine each company's earning power (before growth), which means we can be fairly certain of whether or not Mr. Market is offering us a good deal.|My favorite profitability metric is return on invested capital, or ROIC. ROIC is calculated by dividing pre-tax earnings by invested assets (total assets minus excess cash and working capital). A good ROIC is the same as a good return in your stock portfolio; a company that consistently earns an ROIC above 10% creates a lot of value. eBay, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola all earn greater than a 10% ROIC.|If Coca-Cola continues to earn a 19.65% free cash flow margin -- a feat it has accomplished for many years now -- then it should generate $9.2 billion in free cash flow in the average year even if it never grows sales. If you divide $9.2 billion by Coca-Cola's market capitalization, you get a free cash flow yield of 5.1%.|For investors to get a 10% or higher return on Coca-Cola, the company would need to grow sales per share at close to 5% per year. For McDonald's investors to receive a 10% return, the company would have to grow sales per share by nearly 6% per year. For eBay, the necessary growth is just under 4% per year.|Ted Cooper has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Coca-Cola, eBay, and McDonald's.

While many retailers struggle amid high unemployment and weak gross-domestic-product growth, Wal-Mart continues to grow richer each year.|(1) Wal-Mart made $32,342 in profit per minute during fiscal 2013Wal-Mart receives harsh criticism for paying its rank-and-file employees less than it takes to breach the federal poverty level. Although Wal-Mart's wages are competitive with other retailers, its insane profitability may explain why Wal-Mart is the face of corporate evil and not, say, Sears.|Wal-Mart reported nearly $17 billion in net income for fiscal 2013. That comes out to $32,342 per minute -- more than most of its employees earn in an entire year.|Wal-Mart's executive pay is not helping to squelch animosity toward the company's pay practices either. According to data compiled by Nerd Wallet, outgoing CEO Mike Duke's pension is worth $113 million -- 6,182 times higher than the average 401(k) balance for Wal-Mart employees.|Given that Wal-Mart has a durable competitive advantage as the largest retailer on earth, it is unlikely that any executive creates $100 million in additional value for the company. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, Wal-Mart is a business that even an idiot can manage successfully. Despite excessive executive pay, Wal-Mart's market leadership and enormous profits provide reasons to buy and hold the stock.|(2) The Walton Family is collectively worth more than the poorest 30% of Americans combinedThe heirs to Sam Walton's fortune collectively own more than half of Wal-Mart's stock -- a stake worth more than $130 billion. Combined, the Waltons are worth more than the poorest 30% of Americans.|Although somewhat misleading (about 25% of Americans have zero or negative net worth, therefore anyone with a buck to their name is richer than the bottom quartile), the Walton family's massive wealth is evidence of the enormous value created by Wal-Mart in its 51 years of operation. Indeed $10,000 invested in Wal-Mart in 1973 would be worth $12.7 million in 2013.|(3) One in four sales of Clorox and J.M. Smucker is made at Wal-MartIt may be hard to believe, but even big and established companies like Clorox (NYSE: CLX) and J.M. Smucker (NYSE: SJM) would be severely hampered if Wal-Mart stopped carrying their products. The two companies -- with a combined market value of $23 billion -- depend on Wal-Mart for 26% of their sales.|Unlike many of Wal-Mart's smaller suppliers, Clorox and J.M. Smucker are not completely at the mercy of the retail giant. Many of Clorox's brands are must-haves for any retailer -- including Wal-Mart.|According to Morningstar, 90% of Clorox's portfolio is the No. 1 or No. 2 brand in its category. If Wal-Mart did not carry its brands, which include Glad, Hidden Valley, and Kingsford, consumers might opt to go to a retailer that did carry those brands. Likewise, Smucker's lineup of must-have brands includes Folgers, Jif, and Pillsbury. Therefore, Wal-Mart's relationship with these megabrands is symbiotic in nature, not exploitative.|(4) Each additional Wal-Mart Supercenter per 100,000 people increases the obesity rate by 2.3 percentage pointsA study conducted by Charles Courtemanche, assistant professor of economics at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, found that "the proliferation of Wal-Mart Supercenters explains 10.5% of the rise in obesity since the late 1980s."|The author surmises that Wal-Mart's low prices enable people to buy more food, thus allowing them to stuff their faces more than they used to. A more cynical observer might conclude that Wal-Mart's low wages have forced its poor employees to eat fast food because it is all that they can afford.|Bottom lineWal-Mart is an all-American success story. Like all success stories, it has its share of controversy. But no matter what comes up, the world's largest retailer will continue generating billions in profits for shareholders as each year goes by.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/30/steer-clear-of-sears.aspx|11/30/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|3|Too much competitionWhen is the last time you visited a Sears? When was the last time you visited a Target (NYSE: TGT) or a Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) ? I'm going to assume that most Foolish readers are more likely to visit a Target than a Wal-Mart, but Wal-Mart has no problem drawing people to its stores. Even if you don't enter a Wal-Mart, it's a near certainty that you have seen one of their parking lots while driving by. Unless it's late at night, the parking lot is always packed.|While Wal-Mart might not be your favorite haunt, it's not likely that Sears is either. If you're looking for home appliances, you're more likely to visit a Home Depot or Lowe's. If you're looking for apparel, then there are too many retail options to list. If you desire electronics, then you're most likely going to opt for Target, Wal-Mart, Apple, Best Buy, or Amazon. In short, Sears is facing competition from every angle. This is why Sears Domestic saw a 4% comps decline in the third quarter, primarily due to weakness in electronics, lawn and garden, tools, home appliances, apparel, and Sears Auto Centers. Sears Home stood as the one bright spot.|Regardless of where you shop, Wal-Mart has been more effective with its promotions than Sears. Wal-Mart recently stated that it will match competitors on any Black Friday deals, which began on Nov. 22. Wal-Mart also stated that Cyber Monday savings will begin on Nov. 30 and it offers up to 60% off, with free shipping on orders over $35.|Target and Wal-Mart generate positive cash flow, and lots of it, which leads to generous shareholder returns, including above-average yields. This will also make it much easier for Target and Wal-Mart to pay down their debts, which shareholders like to see. For Sears, it will be a challenge to pay down debt and grow the top line simultaneously. The best shot for Sears is now, prior to interest rate hikes. Fortunately for Sears, those could be a long time from now.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/30/does-wal-mart-have-a-liquidity-problem.aspx|11/30/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|2|Does Wal-Mart Have a Liquidity Problem?|Take a quick glance at Wal-Mart Stores' (NYSE: WMT) financials and you would be forgiven for thinking that the company is in trouble. In particular, it would appear that at first glance, Wal-Mart is unable to cover all of its current liabilities falling due within 12 months with current assets.|What's more, an analysis of Wal-Mart's quick ratio appears even more troubling. The quick ratio is more indicative of current liquidity than the current ratio because it excludes inventories from current assets. Inventories generally take time to be converted into cash. If they must be converted into cash quickly, the company may have to accept a lower price than book value for these inventories.|Unfortunately, Wal-Mart has a quick ratio of 0.2, which means that excluding inventories, Wal-Mart only has $0.20 for every $1 in liabilities falling due within 12 months.|In some cases, this would be a bad thing and investors would be advised to stay away from Wal-Mart. Usually a company that cannot meet short-term creditor demands could be facing an imminent threat of bankruptcy.|Unsurprisingly, Wal-Mart's low quick ratio is also a result of supplier leverage. Specifically, at the end of the fiscal third quarter the company had $49.6 billion in inventory booked on its balance sheet; accounts payable totaled $39.2 billion for the period. Short-term debt amounted to $12.8 billio,n but I feel silly to suggest that Wal-Mart, as one of the world's largest corporations, would have trouble paying that back or refinancing.|Foolish summarySo all in all, a low quick ratio is fairly standard within the retail industry and investors have no need to be concerned about Wal-Mart's low level of working capital. Actually, this is helpful to know when examining the retail sector in general: a low quick ratio is not always a bad thing.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/30/warren-buffetts-3-favorite-consumer-products-stock.aspx|11/30/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|4|Warren Buffett's investments in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) are significant not only because of the Oracle of Omaha's outstanding track record but also because of his extreme portfolio concentration.|Although Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 43 stocks in its portfolio, most of its positions are tiny and inconsequential. The largest nine positions account for 81% of the portfolio -- and Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart are three of those nine. As three of Buffett's top nine investments, each is an important stock for coattail investors to scrutinize.|Buffett goes to wally worldWal-Mart is a 4% position in Berkshire's portfolio after Buffett more than doubled his stake in the company in late 2009. If you investigate Wal-Mart's competitive position, it is not hard to see why Buffett loves the company.|Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world, giving it unmatched bargaining power in negotiations with suppliers. For many consumer-products companies, Wal-Mart is the single most important customer. This is a powerful position -- one that Wal-Mart is not shy about exploiting.|In addition to being the largest retailer by sales, Wal-Mart is also the largest non-government employer in the world. The company is often accused of paying its employees unlivable wages, but as the only option for many unskilled workers seeking employment, Wal-Mart's low wages are better than no wage at all.|Ethical misgivings aside, Wal-Mart's ability to exploit its bargaining power on suppliers and employees, and its ability to destroy smaller competitors, gives the company a defensible competitive position that will create value for shareholders for years to come.|Bottom lineCoca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Wal-Mart are not just three companies in a legendary investor's portfolio -- they are three companies that account for one-third of a legendary investor's best bets. Each has a defensible competitive position and will reward long-term shareholders over the coming decades.

However, when compared against industry peers like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) , the stock is trading at a considerable premium. Can Costco continue outgrowing the competition in order to justify its valuation?
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/29/which-credit-card-companies-are-crushing-it.aspx|11/29/2013|0|"American Express"|0|American Express (NYSE: AXP) is up 48.7% year-to-date, Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) is up 23.3%, Master Card (NYSE: MA) a whopping 54.3%, Visa (NYSE: V) 34.5%, and Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) (NYSE: DFS) 38%. With the exception of Capital One, all of these companies are outperforming the S&P 500 in 2013, which is up about 26.5%. The short answer to the question asked in the headline: all of them.|The S&P 500 is currently priced about 19 times earnings, and currently the average P/E ratio of the entire credit-services sector is about 18.2. Visa, Master Card, and American Express currently trade around 27x, 30x, and 20x earnings, respectively. Capital One and Discover trade between 10-11x earnings, and they both deliver a dividend yield of roughly 1.5% while their peers offer yields between 0.30-1.1%.|American Express has been a top performer this year, second only to Master Card in year-to-date stock performance. This is despite having the lowest four-year-average profit margins among its peers, along with steadily slowing revenue growth. Many investors think this stock is a good buy because it still has room to grow and could perhaps catch up to the higher valuations of its peers. American Express is priced at 20x earnings, which is right in the middle among its competition.|Capital One Financial has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its peers. While the company's profit margins are on the lower end with those of American Express (roughly 12.5% on average), revenue growth picked up in 2012. In 2013, however, revenue is expected to come in at or slightly below 2012 revenue. Capital One is tied with Master Card on having the lowest beta in the group and offers a nearly 1.7% dividend yield -- the highest among the tickers mentioned here. I think this stock deserves a close look from investors considering how cheap it looks on paper. But sometimes, like with other things in life, you get what you pay for.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/29/why-arent-giant-jets-selling.aspx|11/29/2013|0|"Boeing"|1|In the late 1960s, the Boeing (NYSE: BA) 747 represented the latest in commercial aviation achievements. Becoming the largest passenger airliner at the time, the characteristic hump of the plane signified the power of aerospace engineering. Fifty years later, Airbus, a subsidiary of European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , has passed the 747 in size with its A380 superjumbo.|But despite the modern technologies incorporated into the Airbus A380 and the redesign that created the Boeing 747-800, neither of these colossal jets have become the sales sensations they were targeted to be.|Slow salesWhile the 747-800 and the A380 both bring the latest in aerospace technology to the world's largest passenger jets, sales have not been quite so large. Boeing recently slowed the production rate on the 747-800 to 1.5 aircraft per month amid slow sales. In an attempt to help clear a glut of older 747 aircraft, Boeing has set up a trade-in program where airlines can trade in old 747 models to partially finance the purchase of a 747-800. In a world where fuel costs make disposing of old jumbo jets increasingly difficult, the trade-in program seems to be a logical move to sell new jumbo jets.|OutlookFortunately for Boeing and Airbus, orders for these aircraft are not just disappearing. Thanks to advances in other Boeing and Airbus aircraft, twin-engined models stand to pick up many of the orders not given to jumbo and superjumbo aircraft. Among the benefiting aircraft are the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350, twin-engined aircraft with large capacities and long ranges.|Both these jets run on four engines that burn a lot of fuel. The trade off for a slightly smaller passenger capacity with a plane that needs only two engines like the popular Boeing 777 series seems to make more economic sense.|As for 747-8 sales, remember that Boeing never expected enormous sales, but to divert some sales from the A380. To the extent that the very large airplane market does not materialie, both the A380 and the 747-8 will be affected.|The thing is that US airlines really don't have a need for the A380 and the same is nearly true with the 748i. Only United and Northwest ordered the 747-400 and American and Delta opted for the MD-11 (although they were short-lived in AA service), Continental ordered the A340 (along with the A330), but those orders got canceled. TWA ordered the A300, but canceled the order (Their A318 order was supposedly made to make good on the canceled A330 order.). Delta became a 747-400 operator via the merger with NW and when they do decide to replace the 747-400s, it will likely be for more twin jets from either Boeing or Airbus (or a mix) instead of a four engine a/c.

But compared both to the 23% gain for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the 17% jump in shares of rival Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , Exxon's returns don't look all that impressive, and the oil giant still has something to prove to investors that it can deliver leading returns even with its massive size.|Exxon faces the same challenge that many big oil companies have had to deal with lately: finding ways to replace falling production from aging wells with new sources of oil and gas around the world. Even with monumental discoveries in unconventional plays like ultra-deepwater drilling and shale oil and gas formations, Exxon and its peers have to maintain the pace of capital investments in order to keep up with the rate of depletion of its legacy assets. Can Exxon keep up with Chevron and its other industry rivals? Let's take a closer look at what moved shares of ExxonMobil in 2013.|Why hasn't ExxonMobil stock done better in 2013?As you can see above, ExxonMobil has struggled for most of the year. Without a sizable rebound in just the past couple of months, Exxon might have threatened to be one of the Dow's few losers for the year, and it has consistently failed to match up to Chevron's performance.|One big headwind against Exxon has come from its not being ideally positioned to take advantage of some of the most favorable opportunities in energy lately. For instance, even as U.S. oil and gas production has skyrocketed, Exxon still gets most of its production from international sources. That has made it challenging for Exxon to find enough good projects to sustain its output, something that Chevron has managed to do more successfully and on a more consistent basis.|Still, Exxon, Chevron, and many other oil and gas companies haven't been happy to see oil prices stagnate and even head lower recently. In particular, West Texas Intermediate breaking under $100 per barrel has had a painful impact on revenue and earnings throughout the industry. Yet the increasing spreads between WTI and overseas Brent crude prices could help Exxon's refinery operations turn around in the current quarter. That shows some of the benefits of Exxon having decided to remain an integrated energy company, rather than spinning off its refinery operations as many of its peers have done in the past few years.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/29/what-should-cisco-buy-next.aspx|11/29/2013|0|"Cisco Systems"|0|What Should Cisco Buy Next?|Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) takes pride in having a presence in all areas where an Internet connection is possible. But, in recent quarters, it appears as though competition is intensifying in two key businesses: the server and router segment, and cloud computing/cyber security. As a result, Cisco should consider major moves to solidify its place as a long-term tech leader, which could then drive its stock higher.|Becoming an acquisitive companyCisco is a large company with nearly $50 billion in annual sales. Approximately half of its business is derived from servers and routers, but with a rise in software-as-a-service and big data, Cisco has made aggressive attempts to build its software business.|In recent years, Cisco has been one of the most acquisitive tech companies in the market, spending more than $10 billion in the last three years, with nine of the last 10 acquisitions being software companies. In the meantime, Cisco has struggled with slow growth in Japan and China, and in its last quarter saw product revenue rise just 1% year over year.|The company's service revenue was marginally positive in the last quarter, seeing growth of 4%, but far below the rate at which many of the company's peers are growing. With that said, Cisco is doing all it can to acquire growth, and with $48 billion in cash, two companies in particular might help boost investor sentiment.|Acquiring low-end growthThe largest problem involves servers and routers. As stated, it's the largest chunk of sales, but Cisco faces intense pricing competition, especially in the low-end edge router space.|During the company's fiscal second-quarter report, Cisco reported that it lost market share in the low-end edge router space. This is an area that Cisco has controlled for many years, but is likely losing share to Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) .|Juniper, along with Hewlett-Packard, is Cisco's biggest competitor in the server and router business. While HP is more diversified, Juniper operates more in the enterprise business (security) and low-end router space. In Juniper's last quarter, it saw double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth in its carrier low-end routers.|The router business has been very strong for Juniper, a multibillion dollar segment. Seeing as how Cisco is in the business of acquiring growth, it might view Juniper's double-digit performance as a lucrative opportunity, especially without its software segment. With Juniper trading at 2.2 times sales, it appears that Cisco could acquire the business for a fair value price.|The growth of securityIf Cisco were to make a splash by acquiring Juniper, it would obtain a declining security business, which might have good synergies with Cisco's own security segment. However, Cisco is not losing market share to Juniper in this segment. Instead, tech giant Oracle and smaller rival Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW) are hindering Cisco's performance.|In cloud computing and cyber security, Cisco used to have pricing power, but due to the rise of new competitors, Cisco no longer has the pricing freedom that it once had. Thus, Palo Alto looks like an attractive acquisition target, a company that's really firing on all cylinders.|For Cisco, it saw service provider orders fall 13% year over year, and does not expect a pick-up in demand in the near future. Thus, Palo Alto, with its accelerated growth, would be a nice addition to Cisco's business. While Palo Alto is expensive at nine times sales, Cisco could likely scale up growth at a quicker rate.|Final thoughtsCisco has encountered a number of problems in the last three years, much of which can be traced to macro issues. However, Cisco does have issues it can control, such as losing market share to both Juniper and Palo Alto.|An acquisition of either or both might change sentiment toward Cisco stock, pushing it higher. If not, investors have to like what both Juniper and Palo Alto are doing in each industry, thus meaning that both will be fine with or without Cisco. However, if Cisco keeps losing market share in major segments, it might soon experience even more downside pressure.|"In recent years, Cisco has been one of the most acquisitive tech companies in the market, spending more than $10 billion in the last three years, with nine of the last 10 acquisitions being software companies."|Over the past 4-years, Cisco's 1st Quarter operating profit has soared an incredibly robust +$331 million while during those same 4-years, Cisco's 1st Quarter goodwill merely increased by a less than noticeable +$10.862 billion.

In its most recent quarter, the company managed to boost production by 1.5%, topping investors' expectations and reversing year-ago drops in production levels. Even though overall revenue and income fell, Exxon enjoyed sizable earnings gains from its upstream segment, partially offsetting weakness in the downstream refinery business as some of the pricing factors that had previous helped refining operations be extremely profitable began to fade somewhat.|Still, Exxon, Chevron, and many other oil and gas companies haven't been happy to see oil prices stagnate and even head lower recently.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/29/what-2014-has-in-store-for-nike.aspx|11/29/2013|0|"Nike"|0|What 2014 Has In Store for Nike|The athletic apparel designer and manufacturer Nike (NYSE: NKE) , best known for the marketing slogan "Just Do It" and the Nike check mark or "Swoosh," was one of the three components added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) this past September. The addition happened in a trade where Hewlett-Packard, Alcoa, and Bank of America were removed from the Dow and Nike, Goldman Sachs, and Visa were added. And despite the fact that Nike has only been a part of the Dow for a few months, if things remain constant, Nike will finish 2013 as the Dow's second-best performer of the year as the stock is currently up more than 53%, just behind Boeing's 78% it has increased year to date.|Compared to the most recent earnings results when Nike posted quarter revenue growth of 7.7%, slightly below what analyst are looking for this coming quarter, the apparel company reported a 37.6% increase to earnings last quarter, which makes the 1.8% growth expected during the current three-month period a little more understandable.|But when these growth rates are compared to Nike's competition, the company stacks up very well, especially considering it is multiple times larger than its closest rival.|As you can see, while Nike isn't predicted to have the best growth in the coming year, the growth it is being predicted to display is healthy and substantial for a company Nike's size.|Furthermore, for a retail/fashion company to not only stick around as long as Nike has, but to be the size that it has grown to and still being expected to grow by double digits, is absolutely amazing. Additionally, when compared side by side, the Under Armours and Lululemons of the world would need to increase their growth dramatically to catch up with Nike and the fact that these new comers like Under Armour and Lululemon, (who may not be new now but weren't around when Nike first started) haven't been able to eat Nike's lunch as we often see in the world of fashion, does say a lot about the Nike brand and customer loyalty. And that is what sets Nike apart from the others.|Like all the great retail/consumer-focused companies, Nike has built a brand that customers know, trust, and are willing to pay a little extra for. On top of that, Nike expanded its brand to the Jordan collection, which started as just shoes but is now its own line of clothing and accessories. They have now not only built one brand but two. As the company continues to expand its reach around the world, grow its product offerings, and develop new brands in the coming year, I believe Nike will not only be able to hit the growth estimates posted above but beat them.|Lastly, you may be wondering which of the athletic retailer would be best to buy going into 2014. Based on all things being considered, it is easy to toss Adidas out from the get-go. Lululemon has experienced a lot of issues over the past year with the sheer, see-through pants and comments from the company's founder, so based on those reasons, I'll toss the lemon away. As for Under Armour and Nike, I believe you can't go wrong with either company. I personally own Under Armour but would be a buyer of Nike at today's price. The only difference I see with the two is that Nike is just a slightly older, more mature, slower-growing company, whereas Under Armour is still experiencing that fast, high growth. But again, either is fine and they both have pros and cons. Nike pays a dividend, Under Armour does not. Under Armour is growing fast and will likely continue to do just that but is still small while Nike is a larger company and can move into any new market around the world and Under Armour just isn't at that level yet.|Final thoughtsAll in all, Nike will continue to perform well in 2014 and the coming years due to its brand strength and its ability to constantly stay relevant and on the cutting edge of fashion and athletic technology. Will the stock rise another 50% in 2014? I wouldn't bet on it, but if the company can keep growth rates at a decent level, I believe it will continue to beat the market.|The Motley Fool recommends Goldman Sachs and Lululemon Athletica.

Last quarter, global Lipitor sales fell 29% year-over-year to $533 million.|Despite that gaping hole in its top line, Pfizer has aggressively cut costs by shutting down redundant facilities, selling business units, reducing its R&D footprint and sharpening its focus, and cutting more than 50,000 jobs over the past eight years. The end result, as seen in the following chart, is a company that has been able to grow its EPS by triple digits over the past two years, even though its revenue has fallen dramatically.|Now, as we approach the end of 2013, let's take a look at three major things Pfizer investors should pay attention to going into 2014 -- and how Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) , Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) , Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) , and Novartis (NYSE: NVS) could affect its future.|An apparent heir to LipitorFirst and foremost, Pfizer hasn't given up on the cholesterol crown yet. Its former blockbuster Lipitor, along with Merck's Zocor and AstraZeneca's Crestor, were all statins -- the widely used standard of treatment for high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol.|Therefore, Pfizer is moving beyond statins and testing RN-316, a new type of cholesterol drug known as a PCSK9 inhibitor. PCSK9 is an enzyme which binds to the liver's LDL receptors, degrading them and throttling the liver's ability to lower LDL cholesterol levels. RN-316 attempts to inhibit the production of PCSK9 so LDL receptors are able to lower levels of cholesterol more naturally.|Pfizer is banking heavily on the success of RN-316 -- it is testing the drug on a massive phase 3 group of 22,000 patients with a wide variety of cholesterol levels.|However, three other companies -- Sanofi, Regeneron, and Amgen -- are also competing against Pfizer in the PCSK9 arena. Sanofi and Regeneron's alirocumab is forecast to generate annual peak sales of $3.5 billion if approved, and Amgen's AMG 145 is expected to hit $4.0 billion. Both drugs are also currently in phase 3 trials, and both companies have already released encouraging interim data.|Growth in oncologyLast quarter, Pfizer's oncology portfolio accounted for only 3% of its top line. However, it was also the company's fastest growing segment, with 24% year-over-year revenue growth. The three main drugs to pay attention to in this segment are Xalkori, Inlyta, and palbociclib.|However, the most promising treatment in Pfizer's oncology portfolio is palbociclib, a breast cancer drug which could generate peak sales of $1.9 billion by 2019, and up to $5 billion if approved for other indications.|The upcoming three way splitLast but not least, Pfizer investors should be aware of the company's upcoming three-way split.|Starting in fiscal 2014, Pfizer will be split into these three groups:|The financials of the three segments will be reported separately, although they will all remain under the Pfizer umbrella. This means that the split is really an experiment to test the viability of spinning off or selling its businesses to streamline its revenue growth.|Earlier this year, Pfizer spun off its animal health unit, Zoetis, into a publicly traded company-- a shrewd move that allowed Pfizer to profit from the IPO and avoid a large tax bill from an outright sale.|Pfizer has stated that it intends to wait three full fiscal years before deciding whether or not to spin-off or sell any of the three units, such as its generics business -- which reported a 4% year-over-year sales decline last quarter but still comprises 18% of its top line.|The Foolish takeawayIn closing, Pfizer is hardly the boring, slow growth stock that some investors presume it to be. With new opportunities in cholesterol and cancer treatments, Pfizer still has plenty of opportunities to revive its lagging top line growth.|In the meantime, Pfizer excels at preserving its bottom line and its forward annual dividend yield of 3% -- both solid reasons to stick with this stock in 2014.|Another stock with big growth aheadPfizer's a solid bellwether bet on big pharma, but investors with a greater appetite for risk might want to check out this incredible tech stock. It's growing twice as fast as Google and Facebook, and more than three times as fast as Amazon.com and Apple.

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) ended the day up just 0.1% today despite a statement this morning in which the company called this another record-breaking Black Friday -- but didn't really specify what was record-breaking about it. The report did say the company saw 22 million customers last year and had more this year, recording more than 10 million transactions from 6 p.m. (when most locations opened) to 10 p.m. on Thursday.|But while the company was upbeat about the performance, some of the more than 1,500 planned Wal-Mart protests today led to arrests at a few locations. Demonstrators are calling for higher wages at the largest private employer, as they say the pay isn't enough to live on. Looking for an across-the-board pay increase to a minimum of $12.50 an hour would allow workers to support themselves and their families, protestors said. Wal-Mart officials responded to today with an additional press release saying the average full-time employee makes $12.81 an hour and that the company is proud of its wages and benefits, which it says include affordable health care, 401(k) access, educational benefits, and performance based bonuses.|Two other retailers making the news today because of their share-price moves were Radio Shack (NYSE: RSH) , which fell 2.02%, and Zale (NYSE: ZLC) , which increased by 5.21%. There was no major news for either company today, but there have been some recent events. On Wendesday, Radio Shack released its list of what it thinks will be the top six tech trends expected to dominate this holiday shopping season. Tablets and smartphones were on the list, but Radio Shack also made a case for DIY tech gifts and remote-control toys. DIY tech gadgets, like parts or hobby kits? That sounds like a company struggling to come up with something to boast about. Radio Shack surely knows it can't compete with other retailers, such as Wal-Mart or Best Buy, on price for large flat-screen TVs or other hot tech gadgets. And the only popular remote controls this season are likely to be the ones you need to play on the new Xbox One or PlayStation. I haven't seen a lot of analysts calling for a big push in the sales of remote-control planes or robots.

It was unclear how many of those were actual Wal-Mart(WMT, Fortune 500) workers.|Another 10 people were issued citations at a protest near a Wal-Mart in Chicago for blocking a roadway. Protests also occurred in cities including Alexandria, Va.; Quincey, Mass.; Orlando, Fla.; Bellevue, Wash; Lakeside, Colo.; and Hyattsville, Md.|The protesters are calling for Wal-Mart to pay full-time employees at least $25,000 per year, and to increase opportunities for full-time work.|Wal-Mart currently employs 1.2 million hourly associates who earn an average of about $12 an hour and are also eligible for up to $2,500 a year in quarterly bonuses, spokesman David Tovar said. Of that 1.2 million, "over 50%" are full-time employees working an average of 37 hours per week, Tovar said.|Workers are considered full-time at Wal-Mart if they work 34 hours or more per week. The company's part-time workers average about 27 hours a week.|Over 475,000 of the company's associates earned $25,000 or more last year, according to a Wal-Mart presentation from September.|Protest organizers claimed rallies took place at 1500 locations Friday. Tovar said that number was hugely inflated, and that very few demonstrators were actual Wal-Mart employees.|Friday's protests were organized by OUR Walmart, a group backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. OUR Walmart and the UFCW do not represent Wal-Mart workers, and say their goal is only "helping Wal-Mart employees as individuals or groups in their dealings with Wal-Mart over labor rights and standards."|OUR Walmart held similar protests last year. Last week, the National Labor Relations Board said it was ready to bring a case against Wal-Mart for allegedly retaliating against workers who took part in those protests.|The NLRB, which protects the rights of workers who organize for better working conditions, alleged that Wal-Mart stores in more than a dozen states "unlawfully threatened, disciplined, and/or terminated employees" who participated in legal strikes and protests.|Speaking to CNN Friday, Wal-Mart U.S. CEO Bill Simon denied the NLRB accusations and defended the company's labor practices, saying its pay is above the median for the retail sector.|"Black Friday...is the big stage and Wal-Mart is a big player on the big stage. Those who want to try to change an industry like retail, it's not unexpected that they would be out on Black Friday at Wal-Mart with something to say about it," Simon said.

Discover offers its customers 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in online purchases from October to Dec. 1. American Express is working with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) to give away free Amazon Prime accounts to customers who sign up for its cards.|Creating a perpetual revenue streamThere's an obvious reason credit card companies want you to use their cards online. Once used, retailers save credit card information for future use. At Amazon, for instance, I have three different cards plugged in to my account. When I make a purchase and pick a card to use, the credit card company gets a balance. If it's a Discover or American Express card, they also get the transaction fees.|So, for a small upfront investment, credit card companies can earn processing fees and gather balances in perpetuity. While Discover, American Express, and JPMorgan may lose money initially on heavy promotional activity, they secure their place in your account at department-store sites scattered around the Internet.|Sure, all these promotions come at a cost, but it's hard to see how aggressive promotions today won't lead to big balances -- and big profits -- for years and years. American Express and Discover have an advantage on most credit card issuers, as they get paid twice when their cards are used: first on the transaction fees, and again when interest accrues on carried balances. The others just collect interest on the balances.

Not only is that better than the 23% gain that the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) have seen year to date, it also stands well above what chemical industry peer Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) has managed to achieve. Given the stock's outperformance, DuPont investors want to know what's behind the company's strength and whether it's likely to persist into 2014 and beyond.|DuPont has worked hard to reinvent itself, going beyond its roots as an industrial chemical company to identify the huge opportunity in agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, and seed products that help the farming industry boost crop yields and feed an increasingly hungry world. Seizing on Monsanto's (NYSE: MON) success, DuPont has taken big steps forward in realigning itself as an ag-focused company, and investors have supported that long-term strategy and its promise. Yet some investors remain uncertain about how much more growth DuPont can squeeze from seeds and other agricultural products. Let's take a closer look at what moved shares of DuPont in 2013.|Why has DuPont stock done so well in 2013?As you can see above, DuPont started breaking away from the Dow's returns early in the year, with a big jump in late April and early May starting the chemical giant on its path toward outperformance. Fundamentally, investors have applauded the company's many moves toward transforming itself into a higher-margin company with better growth prospects.|DuPont started reaping the benefits of its transformation early on in the year. The company's first-quarter results showed the disparity between the company's two main businesses, as agricultural revenue rose 14% even as performance chemicals saw sales plunge 17%. Those results were consistent both with the success that Monsanto saw and the relatively lackluster performance of Dow Chemical, which has been far slower about jumping onto the agricultural bandwagon.|DuPont took a major step forward in growing its agricultural business in late July, when it completed its acquisition of an 80% stake in Pannar Seed, a South African seed company with key connections to markets on the African continent. Africa is a largely untapped market when it comes to enhancing crop yields, and products like DuPont's could help revolutionize farming there, representing not just a huge profit opportunity for the company but also making possible big gains in standards of living in Africa.|Competition is fierce in agriculture, but the companies involved also work together in certain cases. Early this year, DuPont and Monsanto resolved patent lawsuits by agreeing to cross-license some of their intellectual property related to agriculture. That's something Monsanto has also done with Dow Chemical, but it also shows how important it is to come up with new innovations in order to have something valuable to trade when patent infringement litigation arises.|DuPont's strong share-price gains reflect the heavy-lifting that it has already done in moving toward a stronger focus on agriculture. As long as the farming industry remains healthy, that move will likely pay dividends for DuPont shareholders. Yet even amid the long boom in agriculture, long-term investors have to remember that even farming is cyclical, and the next downturn could make DuPont's decision seem ill-advised in hindsight.|Click here to add DuPont to My Watchlist, which can find all of our Foolish analysis on it and all your other stocks.

Apart from the sale of interest to PetroChina, ExxonMobil was expected to sell another 10 percent stake to Indonesia's Pertamina.|In August 2013, Iraq said that Exxon will part with more than half of its 60 percent stake in the WQ1 oilfield. The move followed ExxonMobil's growing tensions with the Iraqi government since last year after the company signed a deal with Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan to explore and develop its oil reserves.|The Iraqi government then warned ExxonMobi1 to choose between the WQ1 oilfield and Kurdistan.

However, Pfizer will need to keep current leading seller Lyrica's torrid pace up. Lyrica, a neurological and pain therapy, has picked up sales growth of 10% through the year's first nine months despite already selling more than $3.3 billion worth of revenue through that time. That's fantastic growth for such a strong-selling drug, and similar gains next year would do wonders for investors. Lyrica kept growing at a strong pace in the third quarter, and there's no reason why this drug can't continue surging in 2014 as Pfizer's No. 1 option.|Eliquis has gotten off to a slow start in 2013 after winning FDA approval in the waning days of last year. The drug, which Pfizer co-developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) , hasn't garnered much in the way of revenue this year, but peak sales estimates remain rosy. Analysts project that the drug could garner anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion in peak sales down the road, but don't expect that all to show up in 2014.|Gearing up for Eliquis and XeljanzPfizer will have to split sales with Bristol-Myers Squibb anyway, but the drug should still be a big hit for both of these dominant American pharmaceutical powerhouses that are looking to beef up revenue in the wake of the patent cliff. However, according to Bloomberg, analysts have lowered sales estimates in the near term for Eliquis, with average projections estimating that the drug could see peak sales of more than $600 million by 2016. That's not bad, but it's not the kind of revenue power investors wanted. Eliquis may be a drug that will take more time to get its engines going for Pfizer and Bristol-Myers.|Xeljanz looks like it may not impress in 2014, either. The drug, like Eliquis, has gotten off to a slow start for Pfizer in 2013, and while it's garnered peak sales estimates of up to $3 billion, Xeljanz likely will keep gathering steam in the new year.|In the long run, however, keep an eye on how Pfizer's pipeline develops in 2014.

Typically, retailers would post losses for most of the year and would make all their profits after Thanksgiving and during the holiday shopping season. For a retailer like Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) that is profitable all year, the holiday season is a time to further boost profits.|5. This year's Black FridayThis year most Macy's stores are opening at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. This is a first for Macy's and follows the pattern of many retailers of opening earlier and earlier. The retailer is going to be offering door-busters and morning specials. Macy's strategy is to localize its stores and offer specials catering to customers in a specific region. This allows Macy's to offer specials on winter coats in New York, but not in Florida. To advertise its specials, Macy's hired the music group One Direction to star in a commercial promoting Black Friday and shopping at Macy's.The most aggressive Black Friday retailer this year looks to be Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart launched an early bird Black Friday sales event on Nov. 22 at both of its stores and online.|Foolish assessmentExpectations are high for retailers this holiday season. It certainly looks to be competitive and two retailers to keep an eye on are Macy's and Wal-Mart. Macy's has momentum heading into this holiday season after posting a 3.5% rise in comparable-store sales in the third quarter. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, posted a comparable sales decline of 0.3% in the third quarter. Wal-Mart is counting on this holiday season to turn things around.|Both companies continue to return money to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Wal-Mart has a dividend yield of 2.4% and Macy's yield is 2%. Year-to-date, Macy's has repurchased $1.2 billion worth of shares while Wal-Mart repurchased $1.7 billion in shares in the third quarter alone. I see both companies continuing to repurchase shares and reward shareholders. A strong holiday season would be an added bonus to end the year for both retailers.

Here's a quick rundown of what the program involves, how it started, and how you can participate.|A brief historyThough the Shop Small tradition has only been around for the past three years, American Express really grabbed on to a growing trend of consumers looking to buy locally. Perhaps as a statement to counter the growing masses entering big-box retailers each Black Friday, the date is set each year on the Saturday following Thanksgiving. Within the first year of its plan, American Express's SBS received over 1.2 million "likes" on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) .|A helping handThis year, American Express has listed over 350 separate organizations as partners in the program, including trade organizations, local municipalities, and chambers of commerce. It's handful of "premiere" partners include Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) , FedEx (NYSE: FDX) , Foursquare, and the United States Postal Service. Each company is providing support to small businesses for advertising through either credits (Twitter and Foursquare) or free signage, etc. (FedEx and USPS). The USPS is also providing free shipping for small business orders on the ShopSmall.com website.|Not just for the little guyOf course, the benefit to American Express goes beyond helping local shop owners. The entire event promotes the use of its credit cards, with members getting $10 statement credit for registering their cards before they go out and shop. But American Express isn't about to forget its big partners -- the company recently teamed up with Walmart (NYSE: WMT) to offer the Bluebird loadable card for consumers looking for an alternative to credit and debit cards.|Though the principle of Small Business Saturday is a good one, consumers shouldn't forget that every day could be a "shop small" day, and that American Express will be getting plenty of business on Black Friday as well.

The 787 Dreamliner has been well received by airlines that have created several years of backlog orders. New iterations of the 737 have caused lengthy backlogs of their own and the new 777X model recorded 259 orders at the Dubai Air Show for nearly $100 billion at list prices (however, airlines tend to get substantial discounts so it's unlikely the actual amounts total $100 billion).|The other sideIn the near term, the new aircraft could have an interesting effect on Boeing's sales. It seems the new 777X is so nice that there could be trouble in moving the current still-in-production 777 models. An analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. questions how well Boeing can bridge the gap between the existing 777 and the 777X saying there are currently only 3.3 years of 777 backlog and the 777X will not enter service for another six to seven years. The analyst sees production of the 777 being cut in the future.|The iconic Boeing 747 has also been a tough sell recently. The older generation 747-400 ended production in 2009 and has been replaced with a modernized 747-800. But the jumbo jet is seeing tough competition from Boeing extended range 777 models that can now compete with the 747 in terms of range. As a result, orders for the 747 have been slow and Boeing has slowed production of the plane as a result.|The bright sideBoeing has developed a next-generation series of aircraft that are attracting an impressive number of orders. The only problem is that the new planes are so popular that some airlines may choose to wait for the new models to enter production rather than purchase existing models.|But this is by no means an end for Boeing. It shows the manufacturer has a very healthy product line that airlines are willing to order in advance. Furthermore, demand for current 737 models is still seen at airlines that either want their new planes sooner or are budget conscious and willing to give up some of the advantages the 737MAX will have. Among the buyers is Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) , which ordered 100 737-900ER aircraft back in 2011 for deliveries from 2013-2018. Delta has embarked on a strategy of saving money on aircraft by using older models, even going as far as to purchase 49 teenaged MD-90 aircraft and refurbishing them as well as operating the Boeing 717 aircraft Southwest Airlines acquired in its merger with AirTran.|Filling the gapAirlines tend to pick up the pace of fleet renewal in good times and reduce orders in bad. This trend is a strong positive for commercial aerospace manufacturers like Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, and Bombardier. The airline industry is experiencing a relative period of stability as mergers have consolidated major carriers and the expected merger between US Airways and American Airlines parent company AMR will reduce the number of large legacy carriers to only three.|Airlines have been placing big orders as the industry becomes more stable and fleet modernization programs are implemented in full force. As a result Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer are taking some of their largest ever orders.|For Boeing, the next generation of aircraft may be holding down sales of the comparatively less attractive current generation of aircraft. But buyers such as Delta Air Lines and other carriers that want to quickly renew their fleets or are looking to save on aircraft costs could very well fill the gap between current aircraft and the next generation of aircraft slated to come into production over the next several years.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/27/small-jets-used-jets-and-new-jets-what-they-mean-f.aspx|11/27/2013|0|"Boeing"|6|Single planeThe Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737 is a highly popular plane and has earned the title of the best-selling commercial airliner in history. Among the buyers of the Boeing 737 are Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) and WestJet Airlines (TSX: WJA) , and for both airlines, the 737 makes up the vast majority of their fleets.|But just because the first Boeing 737s have been around since the late 1960s doesn't make the plane old technology. Boeing redesigned the 737 for a next-generation series in the 1990s and is already taking orders for the next iteration of the aircraft -- the 737MAX. Both Southwest and WestJet are still interested in the 737, with Southwest becoming the launch customer for the 737MAX 7 and WestJet ordering 65 units of the 737MAX back in August.|Motley fleetIf Southwest and WestJet are pursuing a modern unified fleet strategy, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) is going after just the opposite. The Atlanta-based carrier has some of every Boeing plane from the 717 to the 777 (except the old tri-jet 727), a selection of narrow- and wide-body Airbus jets, a couple of models of McDonnell Douglas aircraft, and even 16 DC-9s (which average over 35 years in age).|Delta's not entirely ignoring a move toward fleet modernization. The remaining old DC-9s are slated to be retired in short order, and Delta placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. This move of conservative aircraft spending has so far been working out for Delta shareholders, with shares of the airline at all-time highs and Delta being the only legacy carrier to issue a dividend alongside a stock buyback program.|Dreaming of DreamlinersThose finding themselves at odds with Delta's strategy may be right at home with United Continental's (NYSE: UAL) aircraft acquisition plans. The cost reduction surrounding the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has attracted the Chicago-based airline to become one of the largest operators of the aircraft.|You really need to do a little research on the B737. No matter what model you are looking at, from the original (1964), to the B737MAX, the fuselage from the nose to the leading edge of the wing, came from the B727! While Boeing has done a good job "selling" this plane, it is the only jet being produced that has NO FLY BY WIRE TECHNOLOGY. The cargo doors open inward restricting cargo size and the fuselage is the narrowest in anyone's mainliner fleet. It truly defines, "lipstick on a pig". What Boeing should have done is design a new high tech twin jet. If you buy the MAX and take delivery, when you get it, the nose and fuselage will be 50 years old. Looks good from the inside with that new "Sky" interior, but sorta like putting a 2014 Cadillac interior in a 1965 Chevy

Tightening spreads between Brent crude, the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate meant crimped refining margins. Since refining is a significant piece of Exxon's and Chevron's businesses, this has had devastating effects so far this year.|By comparison, Chevron has held up better than Exxon. Chevron's U.S. and international downstream segments generated $1.8 billion in earnings through the first nine months of the year, down 45% from the same period last year. In all, Chevron's net income is down 13% through the first three quarters.|Now, however, the tide may actually turn. As West Texas Intermediate crude falls, Brent crude remains resilient. As a result, Brent's spread over West Texas Intermediate recently reached its widest point in the last eight months. If this trend continues, it should present relief for refining activities, which might actually serve to boost Exxon's and Chevron's earnings in the near future.|The Foolish conclusionFalling oil prices can only serve to suppress profits for Big Oil. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips are certainly not immune. At the same time, steady prices for the international oil benchmark would increase refining profitability. In future quarters, refining would no longer serve as a drag on integrated majors' profits. As a result, ExxonMobil and Chevron would at least benefit from their more diversified business models.|The flip side is that ConocoPhillips, which has held up much better than Exxon or Chevron so far this year, would see its fortunes reverse. That's because it spun off its refining unit and wouldn't benefit from an improved climate for refining. Going forward, this represents a key consideration for energy investors as 2013 draws to a close.

Or, is a smaller peer such as RestorationHardware (NYSE: RH) leading the pack?|Quarter(s) at a glanceThere's absolutely zero debate: Home Depot's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report was incredible! After its report, Home Depot traded higher by more than 1%; Lowe's traded lower by more than 5%. Nonetheless, when compared to other retail industries, both companies had a great showing.|Both Home Depot and Lowe's saw total revenue growth of more than 7%, but what really separated Home Depot from Lowe's with investors was comparable-store sales. Lowe's saw its comparable-store sales rise 6.2% in the quarter, which is very strong, but Home Depot announced an unprecedented 10% rise.|Which is better?If you're considering an investment in either Lowe's or Home Depot, it's really hard to go wrong. Home Depot is growing slightly faster by driving growth at existing stores. Yet, Lowe's is guiding for total revenue growth of 9% in 2013. Therefore, we are discussing a marginal difference in regards to total growth between these two companies.|Home Depot|After looking at key metrics of valuation, Lowe's is clearly the cheapest. Sure, Home Depot has a higher margin but with the two companies operating in the same industry, it seems reasonable that Lowe's has the most room to improve.|Final thoughtsWith a trendy crowd and fewer than 100 stores, it'd be foolish to believe that growth can not continue at a rapid rate. While Home Depot and Lowe's are great companies, both are at the mercy of low interest rates and the public's willingness to build new houses and remodel existing homes. As we've seen with Kors and even Apple, high-end products typically perform well regardless of the broader market.

Algeta may prove a willing seller -- after some haggling -- since Algeta is splitting costs for U.S. commercialization. Those costs totaled $27 million in the third quarter. Handing over full commercialization to the much larger Bayer would also likely make Xofigo a bigger threat to Medivation and Johnson, something both Bayer and Algeta would welcome.|Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(JPM) should turn over a draft complaint used as the lender negotiated a $13 billion deal to settle probes of its mortgage-bond sales and identify an employee who cooperated with the U.S. investigation, according to lawyers for a Pennsylvania bank.
http://www.cnbc.com/id/101231363|11/27/2013|0|"JP Morgan"|1|The U.S. Federal Reserve was pressing JPMorgan Chase & Co to distance itself from its metals warehousing business more than a year ago, documents seen by Reuters show, long before the issue became a focal point in the debate over Wall Street's role in physical commodities trading.|A series of letters between JPMorgan's lawyers and the Fed, released to Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, show Wall Street's primary regulator took a tough stance on the bank's efforts to hold onto the global network of Henry Bath & Sons warehouses, part of the larger RBSSempra commodity trading business it bought in mid-2010.|The correspondence shows the Fed balked at JPMorgan's request to turn the one-time trading assets into a strictly arms-length financial investment back in June 2012, and told the bank it must provide quarterly updates on what it was doing to either comply with banking rules, or sell the business.|The Fed also pressured JPMorgan to dilute the amount of metal held by its own traders in Henry Bath, an issue that has riled major metal consumers and critics of a copper investment fund the bank was trying to launch.|Eventually, by May this year, JPMorgan had decided to simply sell the business, the letters show. Three months later, with broader pressure mounting over Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain, JPMorgan would put its entire physical commodity trading business on the block.|Spokespeople for JPMorgan and the Fed both declined to comment on the letters.|But it has been tackling the issue for years as Wall Street deepened its collective push into commodity markets, a trend that reached its zenith with JPMorgan's $1.6 billion purchase in 2010 of RBS Sempra, which included Henry Bath.|JPMorgan knew from the outset that the warehouses presented a problem. As a Fed-regulated commercial bank, it did not have the authority to own "non-conforming" assets such as warehouses for longer than a two-year grace period (with three possible one-year extensions).|JPMorgan has long said its Henry Bath customers face no long queues, in contrast to the Metro International Trade Services warehouses operated by Goldman Sachs, where metal owners have to wait as long as a year. Goldman has previously denied Metrowas driving up prices or violating any laws.|But JPMorgan has nevertheless been named in a series of class-action lawsuits targeting the industry, and is the subject, alongside other banks and merchants, of a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) probe. The Department of Justice is also looking into the matter.|JPMorgan also created controversy in metal markets by trying to launch a physical copper exchange-traded fund for small investors, which would have been backed by metal stored in Henry Bath sheds. Many in the market feared it would artificially tighten supplies and drive up prices.|By early 2012, other metals traders said JPMorgan was directing aluminum supplies into its own warehouses in Rotterdam, Europe's largest port, and in Chicago.|It is not clear what percentage of metal held in Henry Bath was owned by JPMorgan's traders, but it was high enough to alarm the Federal Reserve and to make it difficult for JPMorgan to classify the asset as a strictly passive investment. By law, banks can only claim the so-called "merchant" authority if there is no interconnection between the bank and the business.|Although JPMorgan operated HenryBath at arm's length on a corporate level, the commercial ties ran deeper, according to a person familiar with the matter.|"Henry Bath has always been a creature of its owners," said an executive at a rival warehousing firm. Prior to JPMorgan and RBS, Henry Bath had been owned by Sempra Commodities, Enron and legendary German trading house Metallgesellschaft.|Despite the apparent obstacles, JPMorgan initially told the Fed it wanted to keep Henry Bath under its merchant authority, which would have allowed it to keep the firm until 2020.|In June 2012, it requested a one-year extension of the grace period to conform the business. But the Fed paused. Instead, after what JPMorgan said were "conversations with (Fed) Board staff", the bank's lawyers submitted a revised request in August, seeking three one-year extensions all at once, with no mention of how it intended to own the business.|By March of this year, it was holding discussions regarding an "outright sale" of the business while also continuing efforts to conform it. JPMorgan was talking to other commodity companies about storing more metal in Henry Bath, in an attempt to "decrease the average percentage" of metals owned by the bank in its 75 warehouses, according to a letter that month.|Just over one month later however, JPMorgan had given up attempting to retain the business as a merchant investment, a letter dated May 1 shows.|JPMorgan's decision to sell Henry Bath this year was made after "internal and external" discussions, said a source familiar with the matter.|"JPMorgan and other banks have adjusted their game depending on the playing field," said Saule Omarova, associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina and a visiting professor at Cornell.

But 2014 could be a big year for the company, as new management aims to return it to earnings growth.|Looking for the next CEOProcter & Gamble's now-former CEO Bob McDonald retired in May, replaced by his predecessor AG Lafley, who came out of retirement to take the position. Lafley, however, doesn't plan to stay for long -- shortly after taking over, he elevated a number of high-ranking executives to run different business groups; one of these will likely be his replacement.|At the Ira Sohn conference in May, Ackman gave a presentation on Procter & Gamble and his expectations for the company going forward. If P&G's new management can execute, Ackman believes the company should be earning $6 per share in 2016. Those earnings, combined with P&G's attractive dividend, incline Ackman to believe that the company is worth $120 per share -- more than a 40% upside.|Right now, P&G is yielding about 2.85%, less than Unilever's 3.48%. Procter & Gamble, however, has a 57-year history of increasing its dividend, announcing a 7% increase back in April. Will 2014 be the 58th consecutive year? It's highly likely, and if P&G can execute on its cost-savings plans, it could raise its dividend more than investors expect.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/27/why-coca-cola-couldnt-out-pop-pepsico-and-the-dow.aspx|11/27/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|0|Why Coca-Cola Couldn't Out-Pop PepsiCo and the Dow in 2013|Soft-drink leader Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has done fairly well for investors during 2013, treating shareholders to a 13% total return so far this year. But given the 23% jump in the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) , Coke's performance looks fairly weak. Even worse, rival PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) has climbed even more substantially, with gains of 26% in 2013. That has investors wondering why Coca-Cola has lagged behind, and what the company can do to boost its performance in 2014 and beyond.|During 2013, Coca-Cola has had to deal with several threats. Sustaining revenue has been a challenge for a long time, but particularly troubling has been slower growth in the company's Latin American segment, which many see as a major potential growth driver for Coca-Cola. At the same time, health concerns have mounted, going beyond obesity-related issues to bring diet soft drinks under scrutiny, as well. With PepsiCo having its snack division to fall back on, Coca-Cola bears the full brunt of the attacks on its carbonated beverage lines, forcing it to emphasize other drinks in order to pick up the slack. Let's take a closer look at what moved shares of Coca-Cola in 2013.|What kept Coca-Cola stock from rising faster in 2013?As you can see above, Coca-Cola kept pace with the gains in the Dow Jones Industrials throughout the first half of the year, but it has largely missed out on the market's gains since July. PepsiCo has done an even better job by outperforming the Dow, and taking even greater advantage of the favorable bull-market conditions.|With Coca-Cola, it's important to go beyond the news of the day and focus on the company's long-term strategic goals. Many of the company's woes lately stem from its failure to deliver on the promises of its 2020 Vision long-range plan, which included accelerating sales growth for its core namesake soft drink while also coming up with new premium brands to supplement Coke's long-term success. Lately, the Coke brand has been under attack on various regulatory fronts, and negative perceptions of sugary soft drinks have presented obstacles to the growth that Coca-Cola anticipated reaping from them. That has shown up in poor results from Latin America, where Coca-Cola has had to deal with the Mexican government's attempts to impose a tax on soft-drink and junk-food consumption.|Yet, even sugar substitutes have caused problems for Coca-Cola. Coke executive Steve Cahillane, who leads Coca-Cola's business in the Americas, acknowledged that recent concerns about aspartame have put the Diet Coke brand "under a bit of pressure." While Coca-Cola has defended the use of aspartame, however, it's also looking at fellow sugar-substitute stevia as a possible alternative.|In light of these challenges, Coca-Cola has done its best to jump on the opportunity in non-carbonated drinks. Since the 2020 Vision plan took effect, Coca-Cola has managed to develop five new brands, bringing in $1 billion or more of annual revenue, most of which are non-carbonated. By focusing on tea, water, juice, and other nontraditional beverages in its acquisition efforts, Coca-Cola is trying to make up for the potential long-term underperformance of its carbonated-drink divisions. But given how large the company's soft-drink business is, it'll take a long time before still-drink growth can offset any weakness in the rest of Coca-Cola's product line.|Overall, the underperformance in Coca-Cola stock seems consistent with the challenges that it, and its soft-drink peers, have faced. Until the company comes up with a resolution to the health-related charges that have come up against its core carbonated beverage business, Coca-Cola could have difficulty regaining the growth trajectory it has enjoyed for so long, and could, therefore, lag behind PepsiCo and the Dow Jones Industrials into the future, as well.|Get more of what you want from Coca-ColaPeople like Coca-Cola stock because of its dividend.

Samsung Galaxy S4 for $99 with two-year commitment I know what you're thinking: "How is $99 for a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone that intriguing of a deal?" Well, at Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , which is offering the deal, you'll get a $100 gift card to be used on future purchases within the store if you purchase a Galaxy S4 with a two-year commitment. In other words, you'll pay some money up front for the Galaxy S4, but the phone, for all intents and purposes, is free!|For Samsung, it brings increased exposure of its flagship product into range for the considerably more cost-conscious consumer that Wal-Mart caters to, while for Wal-Mart it incentivizes consumers to come back into its stores again to spend that $100 gift card.

However, three quarters in a row of year-over-year profit declines for Apple means that it could use a retailing boost this holiday season -- and I feel Wal-Mart's deal could give the company the momentum it needs to forge ahead. For Wal-Mart, simply being able to bring Apple products to its cost-conscious consumers at an affordable price is bound to drive traffic into its stores. Not to mention that the gift card will drive repeat traffic and could lead to margin-stuffing add-on sales.

Wal-Mart is bracing for a backlash, with over 1,500 protests planned against the opening this year. Those actions are unlikely to deter shoppers, though. Last year, the company was also open and it reported strong sales, thanks to the holiday business hours.|Target isn't new to Thanksgiving or to protests, either.

With consumer sentiment so weak, Wal-Mart and Target need to finish the year on a strong note.|The difference between the two groups is evident from looking at their stock performance over the year.

Fortunately, the flight from St. John's to Dublin allows WestJet to operate it with a Boeing 737-700. By using the 737 on the route, it negates the need for the airline to acquire large, more expensive widebody aircraft to service the route.|ExpansionAs WestJet's vice president of sales mentioned in August, the Canadian market is only so large, and WestJet will probably look to expand beyond it. This first move of operating a flight from St. John's to Dublin is a wise move, as 737 aircraft would have to be flown to Dublin for maintenance anyway, and the distance of the flight allows WestJet to continue using its favorite jet aircraft, the Boeing 737.

As if a globally depressed mining industry, falling sales, plant closings, and layoffs weren't enough, its locomotive repair division is under investigation to determine whether it improperly billed customers for unnecessary repairs and dumped railcar parts at sea to hide its actions. So it's being investigated not only for possible fraudulent billing practices, but for potential environmental crimes as well.|In its third-quarter earnings report, Caterpillar said it had received a grand jury subpoena related to charges that its wholly owned subsidiary Progress Rail engaged in the repair and billing scheme. The company also said the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California was looking into violations of environmental laws, since it's alleged the company was dumping brake parts, equipment, and tools into the ocean to hide the fact that the repairs weren't needed.|Caterpillar acquired Progress in 2006 for approximately $1 billion, including the assumption of about $200 million in long-term debt. Caterpillar at the time said the purchase provided "an excellent avenue for diversified revenue growth and earnings stability -- critical elements of our Vision 2020" -- its plan to be, in part, recognized as the leader everywhere it does business.|When you look at Caterpillar's three-month rolling dealer statistics, it's a gloomy assessment of where the heavy-equipment maker's immediate future lies. The North American market had been providing its one ray of light lately, but even that turned south with a 2% drop in retail sales of machines in October. Indeed, my hope that the segment would be its catalyst for growth seems to have fallen flat.|With the company's shares down 5% year to date, but 13% over the past 12 months, I remain cautiously optimistic that Caterpillar will turn into a stellar performer yet.

In particular, Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU) appears to have stolen a few choice contracts in China and Europe.|Alcatel investors can celebrate those crucial wins as the embattled company claws its way back from the brink of bankruptcy.

It passed rival Microsoft (MSFT) earlier this year and it is quickly catching up to Exxon Mobil (XOM), which is currently worth about $415 billion.|Could Google soon pass Exxon? It is not out of the realm of possibility. A difference of $65 billion may sound staggeringly large. But look at the chart below, which shows how much ground Google has gained on Exxon just this year. It seems like Google has one of Exxon predecessor company Esso's tigers in its tank.|Google's stock is up nearly 50% this year. Exxon's shares have gained a mere 9%. It's probably unreasonable to think that Google will continue to surge this dramatically over the course of 2014. But let's say Google's stock goes up 25% more from current levels while Exxon shares go up 5%. If that happens, Google will be slightly ahead of Exxon.|Of course both stocks could take off. Both could plunge if the raging bull market finally decides to rest what must certainly be a weary head. Or Exxon could surge if energy prices spike while Google takes a breather. I'm not suggesting that Google will definitely pass Exxon. But it's not a long shot by any means.|So with all that in mind, I don't see any reason why Google can't continue to climb higher. So instead of asking when Google will pass Exxon, maybe the question should be when Google will top current market value leader Apple (AAPL).

That's something General Motors aims to change when it launches the 2015 Chevrolet Colorado into showrooms next fall.|The key for this to be a solid move for General Motors and its investors is all about pricing. If it drops the price too low, the automaker will cannibalize too many consumers from its most profitable model, the full-size Silverado. If there isn't enough price advantage versus current competitors, the Colorado might have face a tough comeback. The price gap between the Colorado and Silverado will likely be $6,000 to $8,000; that should hit the sweet spot to maximize sales on both ends, but only time will tell.

In other words, traders might have favored buying Home Depot and shorting Lowe's.|Finally, the makeup of its sales is suggesting industry strength. Lowe's declared that its Pro sales "continue to outpace our [do-it-yourself] consumer." Indeed, only a day earlier, Home Depot said a similar statement when its management declared "the recovery of our pro business continues in the third quarter, our pro business grew at a slightly faster pace than our consumer business." Both companies see this as a sign of cyclical strength in housing.|In addition, Lowe's performed well with its large product categories such as flooring, kitchens, and appliances. This is in line with what appliance makers like Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) are saying about the marketplace, and customers' willingness to replace appliances that they bought 10 years ago at the height of the housing bubble. It also confirms the positive outlook in the remodeling market index by the National Association of Home Builders.

Having the two largest home improvement retailers agree and provide positive outlook leaves very little guesswork for investors. Let's take a look at the most notable comments from each company and see just how strong the industry could be over the next 16 months.|Home Improvement giantsHome Depot is the largest home improvement specialty retailer in the world. It currently operates 2,260 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and Guam. Lowe's is the second largest home improvement specialty retailer, behind Home Depot, with 1,831 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|Home Depot's conference call was full of praise, as the company blew away earnings expectations; earnings per share grew 28.4% and revenue rose 7.4%, driven by global comparable-store sales rising a very strong 7.4%. Here are some of the most notable comments that give a direct indication to the condition of the home improvement market today and going forward:|The third quarter could not have gone much better for Home Depot on the earnings front, and my favorite comment came from Carol Tome when she said, "housing is a bright spot in our economy." The housing market was the darkest of all areas during the recent recession, so hearing that it is "bright" and only getting stronger is crucial to our sustained recovery in the United States.|Lowe's conference call took place the day after Home Depot's and it confirmed the expectations of a strong home improvement environment. Lowe's had reported mixed quarterly earnings, but still showed strong growth year-over-year, so management was not fazed in its conference call; earnings per share increased 34.3% and revenue rose 7.3% year-over-year, as comparable-store sales grew 6.2%. Here are some of the key comments from the call:|Lowe's may be the second largest player in the industry, but it is still a very large portion overall. The comment that stuck out the most to me was when Robert Niblock stated, "We expect further acceleration of industry growth next year." Previous comments confirmed Home Depot's expectations of strength for the rest of 2013, but this comment pointed toward a sustained and growing recovery in fiscal 2014.|The Foolish bottom lineHome Depot and Lowe's reported great results, whether or not analysts agree about Lowe's, and both pointed toward a continued recovery in the home improvement industry. There is still much work to be done and growth to be had to get the housing market back to pre-recession highs, but I think we are on the right track. Watch Home Depot and Lowe's closely and consider buying on any significant weakness provided by the market.

Instead, dividend investing requires the analysis of a company's business model, its history of dividend payouts, and if the company is generating ample cash flows to sustain its dividends. The possibility of a dividend hike is an added bonus. With these filters in mind, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) appear to be attractive investment options.|Defensive yieldProcter & Gamble is the world's second largest consumer goods manufacturer. It owns over 250 brands and has operations in over 180 countries -- making it one of the most diversified conglomerates around the globe. And according to its website, Procter & Gamble serves about 68% of the world's total population. So naturally, its massive global footprint and diversified product portfolio adds stability to its overall cash flows. But that's not all.|Procter & Gamble generates almost 40% of its revenues from emerging nations. These nations are expected contribute about 70% of the global economic growth over the next few years. So, P&G's significant exposure to these markets can propel its own growth. This mix of business diversification and growth potential adds fundamental strength to Procter & Gamble.|Speaking of its dividend payouts, shares of Procter & Gamble yield 2.84% at the company's current price. The company has been paying out dividends consistently for the last 123 years, and has hiked these dividends by almost 165% over the last 10 years. In spite of that, its moderate payout ratio of 56.4% suggests that Procter & Gamble can further boost its payouts.|Procter & Gamble generated about $10.22 billion in TTM free cash flows. These free cash flows can singlehandedly cover its annual dividend payout of $6.6 billion, and still leave cash reserves behind. The consumer goods behemoth also carries $6.122 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which can be used to hike its dividend payouts in the future. So, dividend-seeking investors can consider investing in Procter & Gamble with a long-term view.|Final thoughtsAll of these companies seem to have the fundamental strength to support their dividend payouts. Where Whole Foods offers modest yields, Coca Cola and Procter & Gamble offer high yields.

The polyethylene terephthalate, or PET for short, packaging will be used for seat cushions, seat backs, head restraints and door panel inserts. The new Ford Fusion Energi Plug-In hybrid car was recently displayed at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The Fusion Energi is the most fuel-efficient car Ford has ever produced and the interior of the car will now also use less oil with Gevos help. If all Ford model interiors used the Plant Bottle technology, it would save 295,000 gallons of gasoline and 6,000 barrels of oil, according to Gevo.

Worse yet, the latest problem could affect Boeing's 747-8 jumbo jets as well.|So what: Boeing warned that the GEnx engines from General Electric (NYSE: GE) that power some of its 787s and 747-8s may malfunction and lead to loss of thrust (the force that pushes a plane through the air) if they gather ice crystals during thunderstorms. Boeing advised its customers to fly at least 50 nautical miles away from thunderstorm activity area to avoid risk. The warning comes on the heels of six such recent incidents reported by planes that run on GEnx engines.|After Boeing's recommendation, Japan Airlines, the second-largest Dreamliner customer, promptly suspended the 787 services on its Tokyo-Delhi and Tokyo-Singapore routes as a precautionary measure.|Now what: After a series of Dreamliner setbacks, Boeing investors heaved a sigh of relief when the airline booked its 1000th order for the aircraft at the Dubai Airshow last week. The 787 made history as the first widebody plane to reach the four-digit sales mark within nine years of launch. Naturally, today's news was a huge dampener for Boeing lovers.|That said, Boeing's latest warning raises another question on the sustainability of Boeing's iconic 747-8 aircraft. Dwindling demand for the jet compelled Boeing to scale back production by 25% this year, a rate it expects to maintain through 2015. If the engine problem isn't fixed soon, 747-8s could be grounded for a longer period of time, raising the risk of airline operators seeking heavy penalties from Boeing. That's the last thing the planemaker, which already has enough Dreamliner problems to deal with, would want to hear. It could be a turbulent ride from here for the 747s, so fasten your seat belts, Boeing investors.|Boeing may have a rough landing in 2014, but one stock looks poised to emerge a winnerThe market stormed out to huge gains across 2013, leaving investors on the sidelines burned.

Boeing (NYSE: BA) can take credit for pumping the blue-chip index across the 16,000 mark, as the Dow's strongest performer jumped 87% higher. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner jumbo jet looked mighty risky 52 weeks ago but is now turning into a golden goose. Boeing has added 424 points to the Dow index all by itself this year.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) was up one point to 1,805.|The Dow's gain would be 35 points higher today if not for Boeing and IBM, which carry high stock prices that give the companies undue weight in the Dow. The Dow is structured as a price-weighted index so stocks with high prices get proportionally higher weights. IBM currently makes up 7.25% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, just behind Visa's 8% and ahead of Goldman Sachs' 6.7% and Boeing's 5.4%.|Boeingis today's worst Dow stock, down 1.88% ($2.55) to $133.40. Over the weekend, the company asked owners of 787 Dreamliners and 747s with General Electric's GEnx engines to avoid high-altitude thunderstorms that can lead to engine-icing problems. Japan Airlines responded by changing the planes it uses on some international flights. The stock's drop is likely an overreaction given recent headlines of Thanksgiving ice storms that are expected to hamper holiday travel on the East Coast.

Boeing over the weekend warned 15 airlines that 787s with General Electric (NYSE: GE) engines should avoid thunderstorms because of potential icing problems.

But the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) have performed even better, with the average soaring almost 23% so far in 2013. What's behind Chevron's mixed performance, and how can it keep up its competitive position more effectively in the future?|Chevron stands out from most of its peers not for what it has done but for what it has not. Rather than following the lead of many rivals by breaking up into component upstream exploration and production and downstream refining and marketing arms, Chevron and ExxonMobil have both remained integrated oil giants. By doing so, Chevron hopes to reap the best of both worlds, but its sheer size makes sustaining production and finding growth opportunities a constant challenge. Let's take a closer look at what moved shares of Chevron in 2013.|What's behind Chevron's results in 2013?As you can see above, Chevron has had an up and down year, following the Dow's downdrafts fairly closely. Yet in October, Chevron's returns disconnected from the Dow's bigger rise, and lagging Exxon posted a big comeback that eliminated half of the gap between its returns and Chevron's.|One of the big issues that Chevron has faced all year has been the geopolitical situation around the world, especially in the Middle East. With the Syrian conflict ramping up throughout the year amid allegations of chemical-weapons use, the U.S. found itself on the brink of military action. But a diplomatic solution brokered by Russia to have Syria destroy its chemical weapons assets helped prevent oil prices from moving sharply higher. Just this past weekend, a preliminary agreement to the long-standing dispute about suspected Iranian nuclear-weapons activities sent oil prices plunging, as the easing of sanctions against Iran could resolve supply concerns. That might be good news for the economy, but it could lead to continued pressure on Chevron's revenue going forward if prices keep weakening.|For Chevron specifically, though, continuing to find lucrative opportunities for production growth remains the biggest challenge. Chevron has generally done a better job than Exxon in making and developing major finds, with Australia being its major standout for massive natural-gas fields that it hopes to use to drive exports of liquefied-natural-gas to energy-hungry markets in India, China, and the rest of the geographically convenient Asia-Pacific region. Chevron also has eyed West Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, and South America for further development, as well as keeping a production presence in Iraq and Saudi Arabia.|Chevron has looked beyond its traditional oil and gas business for opportunities. Like Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron expects to invest heavily in its refining and chemicals businesses, hoping to take advantage of cheap feedstocks from independent oil and gas producers and diversify their overall exposure to the energy business. In particular, efforts to produce more ethylene and polypropylene could help Chevron serve the plastics manufacturing industry. As long as cheap energy is available, Chevron has the opportunity to take on these massive projects that are too large for small oil and gas companies.|Finally, Chevron's ongoing legal battle over environmental contamination in Ecuador has been a multibillion-dollar distraction to its core business. Although Chevron managed to get an Ecuadoran court's original $19 billion verdict cut in half, the true test for the oil giant involves its U.S. federal court case alleging that the entire verdict should be nullified on the basis of fraud.|Overall, Chevron stock has held up quite well given the less-than-perfect conditions in the energy industry over the past year. As long as Chevron can keep making global finds that are big enough to move the needle on its already huge business, it should be able to keep up with or surpass its Big OIl peers.|Is Chevron your best buy in energy right now?Chevron has a lot of potential to cash in on record oil and natural gas production.

And this is exactly what Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) executive said concerning the revelations about the National Security Agency's spying around the world.|What was the quantified effect of the NSA's activity on Cisco's sales? And what can investors do about it?|The other reason discussed for such a drop off pointed to "inconsistent data" from "macro driven" issues. The percentage of sales from abroad remained similar to previous quarters -- around 40% of total revenue -- with overseas revenue totaling $4.8 billion of Cisco's $12.1 billion in sales for the last quarter.|With Cisco's net margin of 16.5% for the quarter, that missing $200 million in revenue is $33 million in profit. And this doesn't count the potential future losses, which are seemingly large from Cisco's future guidance to "model revenue conservatively." The fallout from these politics could add up.|But how should an investor approach potentially value-destructing political situations? Like any other business risk: Attempt to put a price on just how destructive a certain outcome could be for a company and how much value a company could lose from it. For Cisco, while the market chopped off roughly $20 billion in market capitalization after its earnings report, it's unlikely it will have to deal with much worse political consequences -- especially since the company has managed future expectations. Given this, it still has solid footing in the infrastructure that powers the Internet.|The costs of politicsThe relationship between the U.S. and China is mostly outside the power of Cisco, even though it's likely that it cost the company a healthy chunk of revenue. Now, Cisco needs a reaction that will stem future losses, and its acknowledgement of the issues and guidance for a tough future are honest first steps.

As I mentioned in my earnings preview, commentary from Cisco's management about the state of the industry is just as important as the numbers, and Cisco disappointed on that front.|A decent quarterCisco's results for the previous quarter were somewhat mixed. Total revenue grew by 1.8%, below the guidance of 3%-5%, to $12.1 billion. This shortfall was caused by weakness in emerging markets in the last few weeks of the quarter, and is part of the reason why guidance for next quarter is so low.|Non-generally accepted accounting principles earnings per share grew by 10.4% to $0.53, the result of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter Cisco announced significant job cuts, and the effect of this combined with the acquisition of Sourcefire has led to the headcount remaining nearly flat compared to last quarter.|During the quarter, Cisco returned about $3 billion to shareholders. It repurchased 84 million shares during the quarter, for a total of $2 billion, and paid out $914 million in dividends. An additional $15 billion was added to the share repurchase program, raising the total available to $16.1 billion.|What's going on in emerging markets?Cisco's top five emerging markets all saw large revenue declines in the quarter. Brazil fell 25%, Mexico fell 18%, India fell 18%, China fell 18%, and Russia fell a staggering 30%. From the conference call it appears much of this weakness manifested itself toward the end of the quarter, and the weak guidance is the result of assuming that this weakness continues. What isn't clear is what exactly caused these declines. IBM, when it reported its earnings last month, saw hardware sales in Brazil, Russia, India, and China, or BRIC countries, fall by 15%, with China contracting by 22%.|One possibility is the so-called "Snowden Effect." The revelations brought about by Edward Snowden regarding the NSA's various data collection activities could be having a negative effect on American businesses, especially large ones like Cisco and IBM.|With extremely close ties between the NSA and large American tech companies, emerging market countries have a good reason to be wary of the American IT industry. If this is the case, IBM looks to be in better shape than Cisco, as only its hardware business was affected. IBM derives most of its revenue and essentially all of its profits from software and services, and these areas continued to grow.|This effect isn't universal, however. One of Cisco's main competitors, Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) , has stated that the Snowden effect is not real, and that its business in China is still growing. Cisco's weakness could present an opportunity for Juniper to gain share in emerging markets, although it's still not clear that this weakness is anything more than a temporary blip.|It's clear from both Cisco and IBM's conference calls that neither company knows exactly what's going on in these emerging markets. It could simply be short-lived caution on the part of foreign firms, or it could be a more serious NSA-related problem. Either way, a single weak quarter means little, and I wouldn't start to worry unless this weakness persists for a few more quarters.|Back in value territoryAssuming that the emerging market weakness is temporary, Cisco is an incredible bargain after the post-earnings slump. The company has guided for between $1.95 and $2.05 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2014, putting the forward P/E ratio at 10.7 using the midpoint of that range. This ratio, however, ignores Cisco's pile of excess cash. At the end of the quarter Cisco had $32 billion in net cash, or $5.89 per share. Backing this cash out, Cisco's adjusted forward P/E ratio is just 7.8. Even assuming no growth going forward, Cisco is a bargain.|The bottom lineAs a Cisco shareholder the weak guidance is certainly concerning, but it's also not the end of the world. It's unclear whether this weakness is temporary or the result of a more serious problem, but I suspect that the next few quarters will show that the former is the case.|The extremely low valuation gives investors a margin of safety, with a rock bottom P/E ratio creating a buffer against further weakness. The best time to buy a stock is often when pessimism is running rampant, exactly what's happening with Cisco today.

It currently operates 2,260 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and Guam. The company was founded in 1978, went public in 1984, and has been a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1999.|The investor's best friendOne of the two best ways to return cash to shareholders is through dividend payments. Value investors love a good yield and Home Depot currently pays out an annual dividend of $1.56, giving it a yield of roughly 1.97%. It has been paying dividends uninterrupted and without reduction since 1987, resulting in 108 consecutive quarterly payments. The company has increased its dividend 11 times since the year 2000, and this number would likely be higher had the recession not caused the company to tread carefully. Here's a glance at the annual dividends paid over the last five years:|Aside from the percentage yield itself, analysts always like to check the safety of the dividend. It is more than safe and reasonable to assume that Home Depot's dividend is safe from reduction or elimination for the next several years. As you can see in the chart below, the company has increased yearly payments each year since 2009, and I believe this trend will continue over the next several years due to increased free cash flow generation.|Bringing it homeThe other great way to return cash to shareholders is through share repurchase programs. Repurchasing shares reduces the amount of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share and makes the remaining shares more valuable. In February, Home Depot announced that it would be repurchasing $17 billion worth of its shares by the conclusion of fiscal 2015. This actually replaced its previous ongoing program, because there was more capital available. In the third quarter, Home Depot repurchased an estimated 24.5 million shares for about $2.1 billion; this brings the total amount repurchased to $6.4 billion year-to-date. The company stated that it planned to repurchase another $2.1 billion of shares in the fourth quarter.|In the span between 2002 and Feb. 3, 2013, when the newest program was announced, Home Depot had returned an incredible $37.5 billion of cash to its shareholders through share repurchases. This means the company had repurchased approximately one billion shares in just over 10 years; this is almost unheard of in today's market. If Home Depot maintains its recent strong performance, I would not be surprised if the current repurchase program is replaced with a larger one when fourth quarter results are released.|Don't forget about Lowe'sLowe's (NYSE: LOW) is the largest competitor to Home Depot, with 1,758 home improvement stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Let's see how well the company treats its shareholders compared to Home Depot.|Home Depot|Lowe's has had a great run in 2013 and has shown a strong dedication to its shareholders like Home Depot. Over the next two years, it plans to repurchase $5 billion of its shares; this is much lower than Home Depot's current plan, but still very respectable in today's market. Lowe's yield is currently much lower too, but it has raised its dividend for a very impressive 51 consecutive years, and I do not doubt that this streak will continue. Overall, I believe both companies can provide high returns to their shareholders through price appreciation, dividends, and repurchases, but I think Home Depot has the edge at this time. When you factor in earnings growth and other key financial statistics, Home Depot only gets stronger.|The Foolish bottom lineHome Depot's dedication to shareholders is admirable and should be a platform for other companies to imitate. Its largest competitor, Lowe's, has also shown strong dedication, but Home Depot is the "best of breed" in this industry. All of these facts make Home Depot certainly worth a closer look by Foolish investors looking for a best of breed investment for the long term.

CDKs are enzymes that regulate cell division, but when they become overactive or cease to function, cells can proliferate wildly. All three companies are targeting two specific types of CDK -- 4 and 6 -- in order to shut down retinoblastoma phosphorylation, which causes unregulated cell division and tumor growth.|The growth potential of CDK treatmentsLet's compare the three new CDK breast cancer treatments that Novartis, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly are working on.|Pfizer|Analysts believe Pfizer's palbociclib could generate peak sales of $1.9 billion by 2019, and up to $5 billion annually if approved for other indications. In April, the FDA granted palbociclib a breakthrough therapy designation, putting it on the fast track to an eventual approval by 2015.|Novartis only recently announced that LEE011 was entering phase 3 trials for breast cancer, completely surprising Pfizer and analysts, who had not factored in the possible approval of a new breast-cancer drug into forward-sales projections. Novartis' phase 3 trial will also test LEE011 with letrozole against letrozole alone. The trial, which consists of 500 women, is expected to complete by November 2016.|Meanwhile, Lilly still trails far behind both Pfizer and Novartis, and is still testing the drug on a much wider variety of indications.|Targeting a larger marketBoth Novartis and Pfizer are attempting to treat HER2 negative and ER (estrogen receptor) positive breast cancer. This means that both targeted treatments are aiming at a much larger potential market than Roche's treatments, since HER2 negative and ER positive breast cancers both account for over 75% of all breast-cancer cases.|What CDK inhibitors could mean for Pfizer, Novartis, and Eli LillyGoing forward, these new treatments represent strong growth opportunities for Pfizer, Novartis, and Eli Lilly, which have all struggled with patent expirations of blockbuster drugs.|Pfizer's problems are perhaps the best known -- sales of its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor, once the best-selling drug in the world, have plunged since its patent expiration in 2011. To fill the void left by the drug, which generated peak sales of $13 billion in 2011, Pfizer has looked toward growing its oncology portfolio.|Pfizer's oncology portfolio is tiny, only accounting for 3% of its total sales last quarter, but it is also the fastest growing segment, posting 24% year-over-year growth. Pfizer's two fastest-growing cancer treatments are Xalkori, a treatment for non-small-cell-lung cancer, and Inlyta, a late-stage kidney-cancer treatment. Sales of Xalkori and Inlyta respectively climbed 93% and 186% last quarter, but together they only generated $156 million in sales. Therefore, adding palbociclib to its oncology portfolio could seriously increase its oncology's portfolio weight and growth potential.|For Eli Lilly, the benefits are clear -- it has failed to produce any viable replacements for Cymbalta, its expiring blockbuster antidepressant that generated $5 billion in revenue last year. To make matters worse, it reported two major failures in Alzheimer's treatments, which cast serious doubts on the future direction of the company. But Lilly's CDK inhibitor lags too far behind Pfizer and Novartis' treatments to make a noticeable impact.|The Foolish bottom lineIn closing, investors should pay close attention to how the CDK competition between Pfizer, Novartis, and Eli Lilly plays out, since it could unlock a promising new method of treating various types of cancer. These treatments could also represent new opportunities for Pfizer and Novartis to boost their oncology portfolios to finally challenge Roche, the 800-pound gorilla in the field.

Yet even the Dow's big pop hasn't matched that of health-care giant and Dow member UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) , which has jumped by more than 37% so far this year.|It's been a big year for UnitedHealth, and investors certainly haven't been disappointed by the stock's run-up. But can this blue-chip insurer hit the jackpot again in 2014? From growing membership rolls to Obamacare's ongoing rollout, here's where UnitedHealth could be headed in the new year.|Obamacare takes center stageUnitedHealth's done well in growing membership subscription rolls in 2013. Even with rather tepid growth in the third quarter, the company's total medical membership has grown by 24% through the first nine months of the year. But Investors shouldn't expect anything close to that number in 2014, even with Obamacare's launch.|Much of UnitedHealth's membership growth this year has come through the addition to its portfolio of the military's TRICARE system and its more than 2.9 million members. That won't help UnitedHealth's growth in 2014, although it is a bulwark of members that will help the company balance out potential rising costs from the Obamacare rollout. UnitedHealth's 8% growth in its largest single pool of customers, its fee-based commercial subscribers, should help balance Obamacare's launch as well, although growth could be slower given the enhanced requirements of health-care plans under the new law.|And what should investors expect from Obamacare? If early results are anything to go by, don't assume UnitedHealth will benefit much in terms of raw membership growth. The company's hedged its own exposure to the new law by only opting to participate in a handful of state exchanges across the nation.|While this might seem as if it will crimp UnitedHealth's membership growth, it will also contribute to cutting down on rising costs at the company, particularly as many of Obamacare's early adopters are projected by some analysts and observers to be sicker or older. Medical costs have risen faster than premium revenue through the first nine months of the year, so the plan should help UnitedHealth slow down that trend in 2014.|Furthermore, President Barack Obama's recent decision to allow health insurance plans that did not comply with the new rules to be extended for one more year should help UnitedHealth and other big insurers adapt to the law over time. It might not help Obamacare itself much in 2014 if currently insured Americans with noncompliant plans stick with their health care, but it's certainly not a stumbling block for the largest insurance companies.|The new law's cuts to Medicare Advantage payments will also hurt UnitedHealth's growth in 2014. Company CEO Stephen Helmsley has pointed out this problem and responded by(controversially) dropping some doctors. However, Medicare Advantage members represented only roughly 6.5% of UnitedHealth's total subscription base as of the end of the third quarter. The total fallout from reduced payouts will likely hurt, but won't drastically cripple UnitedHealth's growth potential.|The company is growing abroad to help compensate, and its purchase of Brazilian health insurer Amil in late 2012 looks better and better. If health-care reform continues its shaky start into the new year, it wouldn't be surprising to see UnitedHealth make another foreign acquisitions foray in order to offset the unpredictable U.S. market.|The best bet in the industryIn all, Obamacare's rollout will dominate UnitedHealth's 2014. Cost concerns and risk have pushed UnitedHealth and its major rivals away from many state exchanges, and in the first year of the law investors shouldn't expect serious growth to UnitedHealth's membership count. Still, analysts are projecting solid, if not spectacular, full-year earnings-per-share growth of nearly 3.5% in 2014, along with full-year revenue growth of more than 8% -- less than this year's 10.5% full-year revenue estimate, but not a bad number.|It's a year of transition for all insurers, not just UnitedHealth. However, this company's big enough -- and proven enough -- to handle health-care reform's shaky rollout. Don't expect additional 37% yearly gains from UnitedHealth's stock, especially in light of the volatility it has endured since Obamacare's start. However, there's perhaps no other publicly traded insurer as well-situated to sail brightly into the future of health care.

The big players have been jockeying for position. Verizon wanted all the profits for itself and bought the 45% portion of Verizon Wireless that was owned by Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) . The $130 billion deal should close early in 2014 and provide a boost to Vodafone and investors.|Shareholders could get another gift next year -- rumors abound that AT&T, in a bid to expand internationally, would like to buy the European operations of Vodafone in a mega deal worth around $175 billion, dwarfing the $130 billion Verizon-Vodafone transaction.|Verizon will have to deal with the enormous debt it took on after buying out Vodafone. The company issued $50 billion in new bonds to help pay for the majority of the cash portion of the deal. Whether the debt strangles Verizon growth going forward remains to be seen. So far, Wall Street seems alright with it. Verizon shares have risen about 8% since the buyout was announced.|Foolish conclusionIt is likely that air passengers will soon be able to talk and text at 35,000 feet using their AT&T and Verizon plans. This will open up a new market for the big carriers to complement the growth achieved through mergers and acquisitions.

Many large retailers, both online as well as brick and mortar types, have their own versions of same-day delivery. Online purveyors in particular, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) , seem to have perfected the art of instant gratification for customers who want their goods delivered almost instantaneously at the push of a button. But old retailers, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) , have now jumped into the bandwagon and want a piece of the same-day delivery pie too.|Can Wal-Mart and Target match online sellers in same-day deliveries?But not everybody is going to succeed in this game. Old brick and mortar retailers might be some of the unfortunate victims. Amazon and eBay can afford to lose money on same-day deliveries because the resulting revenue growth could easily translate into profits later. As eBay's CEO John Donahue pointed out, the firm can afford to just break even with eBay Now since it has other bigger, well-established and highly profitable operations.|But the same can hardly be said for Wal-Mart and Target. These two have owned online operations for years, but these have remained more of a sidekick than their main forte, accounting for a minuscule percentage of total revenues. Worse still, unlike online companies, old retailer investors do not seriously believe that sacrificing profit margins with same-day deliveries will result in significant revenue growth for the old boys. Same-day delivery might only help brick and mortar retailers to minimize the risk of market share erosion, as customers rush to other retailers that offer the service.

These clinics, offered by CVS (NYSE: CVS) , Walgreen (NYSE: WAG) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) are increasingly used by seniors, the uninsured, and mainstream health care consumers to deliver immunizations, chronic care, and cold and flu diagnosis and treatment. With recent changes to the insurance market tied to the Affordable Care Act, will these clinics become important profit centers for these retailers?|CVS outpaces Walgreen and Wal-MartThe market share leader by far is CVS, which operates 743 MinuteClinics nationwide -- with a goal of 800 by the end of this year and 1,0500 by 2017. The growing base of clinics is providing significant sales growth for CVS, with revenue from the company's clinics up 38% year-over-year in 2012 and up 18% in the third quarter of 2013, compared to a year ago.|Wal-Mart is the third largest operator of these clinics with a substantial opportunity to expand given the company's footprint and resources. Back in 2007, the company announced plans to open 2,000 locations by mid-2012. However, those expansion plans haven't materialized yet. The company's 130 clinic footprint -- 26 fewer than last year -- falls vastly short of that target.|The growth potential is bigCVS, Walgreen, and Wal-Mart retail clinics are in existing stores, giving the companies margin-friendly operating leverage and plenty of cross-selling opportunities for in-store pharmacies, over-the-counter medication and front-of-store general merchandise.|While CVS, Walgreen, and Wal-Mart all plan on increasing services to include chronic care, flu shots remain a major driver of new visits. The short waits and "no appointment necessary" nature of immunizations remains an attractive alternative to busy consumers.

The Twitter feud that ensued was memorable. The question now is whether or not Ashton Kutcher made valid points or not, and if this well-publicized feud is likely to lead to any changes for Wal-Mart, which would then, in turn, likely impact investors.|Paraphrasing the Twitter feudOnce Kutcher got wind of Wal-Mart running an employee-to-employee food charity collection in Ohio, he fired the first shot, asking Wal-Mart via Twitter if its profit margin is so important that it can't pay its employees enough to be above the poverty line.|As a big-box discount retailer, Wal-Mart doesn't sport a high profit margin. It relies primarily on volume, which means it must keep costs low in order to keep its profit margin healthy. This, in turn, helps drive the bottom line, which is what investors want to see.|In my opinion, Wal-Mart made a mistake by responding to Kutcher. Without a response, there's nothing for people to talk about. However, what's done is done.|Wal-Mart replied by stating that the food charity was an act of kindness that was being taken out of context. In Wal-Mart's defense, it did just promote 350 associates as a surprise gesture, and it plans on promoting 25,000 between this month and the end of January 2014.|By this point, you're either hating Wal-Mart or Kutcher. To be fair to both sides, it should now be pointed out that Kutcher has given to at least 14 charities, and that he donated $100,000 to fight malaria in 2009.|Wal-Mart's retort was a video on "Opportunities & Benefits at Wal-Mart," followed by Wal-Mart stating that it would love to talk to Kutcher more about opportunities.|Kutcher then stated that Wal-Mart had $17 billion in profit last year. What he probably knows, yet doesn't want to state, is that it's all about direction for public companies. This is especially the case for a mature company like Wal-Mart. Without growth, investors lose interest, and Wal-Mart is no longer Wal-Mart.|The average full-time pay for a Wal-Mart employee is $12.83/hour. Wal-Mart bought back 7.6 billion worth of shares in 2012. It has been estimated that if this money was put toward the company's employees, it would lead to $6 raises across the board. That's great in theory, but this wouldn't help Wal-Mart reduce its share count and grow its bottom line. Without that bottom-line growth, investors would head for the exits. The cold-hard truth is that Wal-Mart reflects capitalism. Without capitalism, investors would have no way to grow their net worths, and Ashton Kutcher wouldn't be worth $140 million.|More pay and growth for Costco and PriceSmartBefore we get to the details, first take a look at the top-line performances for Wal-Mart, Costco (NASDAQ: COST) , and PriceSmart (NASDAQ: PSMT) over the past five years:|Wal-Mart has shown decent growth because it offers an extremely broad range of products at very low prices, which then drives hordes of consumers to its stores. Value-conscious consumers had been visiting Wal-Mart and spending a lot of their money. Top-line growth has slowed a little recently, primarily due to a lack of wage growth, a payroll tax increase, and the growing popularity of dollar stores. Wal-Mart looks to combat the latter threat by opening in small-box stores next year.|PriceSmart is a discount membership store located in Latin America (high-growth area) and the Caribbean. It owns 32 warehouses in 12 countries, and it looks to expand. I wrote about PriceSmart on October 29, 2013: "A Growth Company You Might Not Know About." In the conclusion, I pointed out that continued growth and stock appreciation was likely, but to be cautious due to a high valuation. That analysis hasn't changed, as PriceSmart currently trades at 34 times forward earnings. This makes PriceSmart more expensive than Costco and Wal-Mart, which trade at 22 and 14 times forward earnings, respectively. Plus, PriceSmart only yields 0.50%, versus Costco's 1.00% and Wal-Mart's 2.40%.|In regard to higher pay, full-time Costco employees average more than $20/hour. This has not affected the company's growth. On the other hand, it's a different business model and environment than Wal-Mart.|The bottom lineNothing here is likely to change. Wal-Mart should continue to show methodical top-line growth while returning capital to shareholders. Costco and PriceSmart offer more top-line potential. PriceSmart has been growing rapidly, and it's looking to expand. These are big positives, but it's higher risk than Costco given its multiple. Costco seems to be the ideal balance of growth and fair valuation.

Today, the company announced that Doug McMillon, who currently oversees Wal-Mart International, will succeed Mike Duke as president and CEO, effective Feb. 1. McMillon joins the company's board, effective immediately. Here are three reasons the company went with McMillon over the other internal candidate, Bill Simon, who runs Wal-Mart U.S.|1. Wal-Mart's international activity is critical to its future growthMcMillon took over Wal-Mart International from Mike Duke when he was named CEO in 2009, so the "foreign route" to the top spot is not a new one at Wal-Mart. With cause: If it is to burnish its growth credentials, international markets are critical to Wal-Mart's future.|Wal-Mart International contributed 29% of the company's revenues in the fiscal year ended in January, but it ponied up 42% of the increase in total revenues. Under McMillon's tenure, Wal-Mart International grew profits before taxes at annualized rate of 8.5%, compared with just 1.3% for Wal-Mart U.S. It can be no coincidence that, in commenting, on his appointment, McMillon said [emphasis mine]: "Our company has a rich history of delivering value to customers across the globe and, as their needs grow and change, we will be there to serve them."|Wal-Mart's international expansion has hardly been without its hiccups. In fact, McMillon has been steering Wal-Mart out of a bribery scandal at Wal-Mart de Mexico, the company's largest subsidiary, that relates to practices dating back to the middle of the last decade. However, faced with a saturating, slow-growth domestic market, foreign markets remain a priority for Wal-Mart.|2. McMillon is a Wal-Mart veteran and insiderWal-Mart is a company with a strong corporate culture that promotes from within. The following table shows the tenure of the three CEOs that have led Wal-Mart Stores since it became a public company (all except for founder Sam Walton) and the year in which each joined the company.|Joined Wal-Mart|McMillon is, it's worth mentioning, an Arkansas native and a University of Arkansas graduate with a long Wal-Mart pedigree behind him. Indeed, he started his career as a summer associate in a Wal-Mart distribution center, before rejoining the company in 1990 in Wal-Mart store in Tulsa, Okla. -- that's a 22-year year career before being named CEO. Meanwhile, McMillon's former rival for the top job, Bill Simon, is a relative newcomer to the company, having joined only in 2006.|Finally, McMillon is reportedly close to the Walton family, which owns almost half of the company. Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton, son of Sam Walton, has been a mentor to McMillon.|3. The U.S. still matters, and McMillon is on top of itFor all the importance of international growth, Wal-Mart U.S. still accounted for nearly 60% of the Wal-Mart Stores' revenue in the fiscal year ended in January; the company can't afford to drop the ball at home (which it has, to a degree, with problems keeping store shelves stocked). One of the benefits of a long career at Wal-Mart: McMillon has been around the shop. Just because his current role has him overseeing the international division, that doesn't mean he's unfamiliar with the U.S. business; in fact, the bulk of his career has been spent in merchandising at Wal-Mart U.S.|Wal-Mart Stores has substantially lagged the S&P 500 over the past five- and 10-year periods. The company faces a number of challenges in terms of operations and public relations, and growth remains elusive. As far as internal candidates go, Doug McMillon looks like the right person to head Wal-Mart Stores, but he's clearly got his work cut out for him.|While Wal-Mart struggles, two "cash kings" are transforming retailTo learn about two retailers with especially good prospects, take a look at The Motley Fool's special free report: "The Death of Wal-Mart: The Real Cash Kings Changing the Face of Retail."

Still, some questioned the wisdom of announcing a leadership change at the start of the biggest shopping season of the year.|Ever since the Great Recession began six years ago, retailers have been forced to offer better and better deals to lure shoppers, eating into profits.

Indeed, that route is somewhat unusual, because while Milan is a large business market, it is underserved because of Alitalia's decision to locate its main hub in Rome instead.

Headquartered in Chicago, the company serves both commercial and military customers in over 150 countries, and is one of the largest U.S. exporters by sales.

By linking the agronomy software of the chemical giant's Pioneer seed division with the farm-equipment maker's wireless-data-transfer architecture, the two want to transform how farmers access data on grain moisture, historical yields, and nutrient deficiencies in their soil so they can know where, when, and how best to plant their seed.|Still, as more farmers adopt these advanced farming technologies, it lowers the bar of resistance. Net farm income is predicted to hit its highest levels in 40 years, making technologically advanced farming equipment like the sort Deere manufactures a lucrative space for growth. Analysts say industrywide sales will grow 3% annually through 2017, with revenues widening at a 5% to 10% pace. The Asia-Pacific region alone is expected to adopt advanced crop-management practices at a compounded annual growth rate of 25% over the next few years. Deere's partnership with DuPont could increase its acceptability.|DuPont has already mapped 20 million acres of farmland in the past year from which it provided 1.5 million acres of variable-rate-seeding prescriptions. While it charges $500 per farm, DuPont plans to boost the price next year after implementing system upgrades, and Monsanto says it will start charging $10 per acre for its precision-planting product.|DuPont's Pioneer division offers crop insurance through PHI, as does Deere through its financial-services arm. Archer-Daniels Midland acquired ADM Crop Risk Services in 2010, which allows it to sell and service policies to farmers, and now that Monsanto has joined the fray, a big data critical mass has formed that can be twisted into a precision financial product.|DuPont Management may try to tackle Monsanto, but it's too late for this troubled Delaware-based conglomerate with identity-confusion and in the midst of splitting apart to copycat Monsanto successfully. Once the largest and leading innovator in seeds in the world, Pioneer gave up its seat over the past decade to Monsanto by virtue of blundering and missed strategic opportunities by DuPont Management. Recall DuPont's first major attempt to develop and commercialise a first-generation genetically-modified seed trait (DuPont OptimumGAP) ended in embarrassing failure. After unsuccessful patent litigation against Monsanto, DuPont has ended up paying Monsanto hundreds of $millions a year in license fees in order to embed Pioneer's otherwise inferior seed-line-up with Monsanto's superior GM traits.|Even with the help of Deere, DuPont will continue to be an also-ran, lagging Monsanto in seeds, and lagging Syngenta in crop protection chemicals.|As a Deere shareholder, we have serious concerns the disreputation of DuPont in agriculture will taint Deere. Witness the colossal DuPont Imprelis consumer product fraud, which has consumed already $1.2 billion in charges against DuPont earnings, with thousands of legal claims still pending in various courts throughout the nation. Ms. Kullman, DuPont Chieftess and her TEAM have commanded and delivered the largest, most costly new product failure and ensuing environmental disaster in 21st century corporate America. Hundreds of thousands of mature landscaping trees have been killed by DuPont's insidiously toxic dandelion lawn treatment, which was marketed deceptively by DuPont Management as "very environmentally friendly", "low impact".|Oh great headline. I had thought that someone was going to squash the GMO seed and have a giant push for organic whole foods, boy was I wrong. Now another conglomerate wants to ruin our food so they can get more profit. Now boycott Monsanto, DuPont, JohnDeere, anyone who peddles these companies products, anyone who uses them, or any food product made from these farmed items.|We will assume that Deere Director, Chad O. Holliday, Jr., erstwhile DuPont Chairman & CEO may have recused himself from voting on the deal. Raises the question is this deal more beneficial to DuPont than Deere? Is DuPont piggybacking on Deere's superior reputation and outstanding leadership in its business?

However, this isn't the first time that soft drinks-to-financials conglomerate has invested in an integrated oil company. When Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) to 5.7% in 2008, the energy company was still functioning as an integrated oil and gas major.|Is something similar suspected at Exxon? The question that Fools need to ask is: What exactly did Buffett have in mind when he acquired a stake in ExxonMobil last week? Is something similar expected at Exxon? Let's explore.|For more than a century, the integrated structure of oil and gas companies has been arguably among the most profitable undertakings in any industry. It's no surprise that the hugely successful Standard Oil had to be broken up in 1911 because of an increasingly monopolistic hold within the industry. The seven successor companies -- having evolved under various mergers and acquisitions -- have been highly profitable, too. Among them are ExxonMobil, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , Conoco (before its merger with Phillips to form ConocoPhillips), and the American arm of BP (NYSE: BP) . In short, the integrated structure served the oil and gas business extremely well.|Will Exxon divest its refining arm? The big question now is: Will ExxonMobil divest its refining arm? The company has underperformed the broader markets for the last few years. Despite an increase in production from last year, earnings slipped thanks to disastrous refining margins, thus bringing into question the integrated model. Growth has been an issue. Here how Exxon's total returns compare with the S&P 500 for the past five years:|Traditionally, Exxon has been a good allocator of capital with impressive returns, which is probably what caught Buffett's attention in the first place. However, growth looks limited at this point unless a spinoff is on the cards. I can't see why the markets have been otherwise undervaluing an excellent company.|Getting gassy and exploring new frontiersThrough its acquisition of XTO Energy in 2009, Exxon has natural gas making up 49% of its total reserves. While natural gas may not garner a lot of attention from the market in the short run, global demand for this commodity is huge in the long run. Exxon is also involved in ultra-deepwater exploration activities. But it remains to be seen how profitable they are.|Final thoughtsThe signs are ominous. ExxonMobil could break up. Or it may choose to stay the same. But definitely a spinoff of some sort will unlock the hidden value in both the upstream and downstream divisions. Warren Buffett has already seen one such divestiture while holding ConocoPhillips. The question is: Is he sensing something similar to take place at Exxon? The time seems ripe. The integrated model seems to be dying. Long live the integrated model.|As an ExxonMobil retiree (and still a holder of significan XOM stock) I have a definite interest in the questions you pose.|One note: As a working interest partner in the Kashagan project, ExxonMobil was not really in control of the project timeline or the budget. ExxonMobil typically has progressed large projects efficiently and within budget, though, as with any company, there are exceptions.|And yes, the Kashagan project has earned the notoriety of being the most expensive E&P undertaking in the world. However, ExxonMobil seems to be running into unexpected roadblocks and delays in other major projects as well (which might just be a temporary setback).|Why would ExxonMobil become un-integrated and have its profitability suffer from volatile crude oil prices? As noted in the article, ExxonMobil (formerly Standard Oil) was integrated precisely for that reason and has been consistently profitable ever since. The company takes a very long-term view of profitability.|No doubt, Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it's a great value play, which your own analysis suggests, not because he has some foreknowledge that the management is contemplating a spin off.|It is clear that Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it is a great investment but.

Today, two of America's largest retailers, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Target (NYSE: TGT) will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeEstablished in 1978, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is the largest home-improvement specialty retailer in the world. The company is also one of only two retailers on the Dow Jones industrial Average, reflecting its importance to the American economy. Home Depot operates more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico catering to both do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM) styles. Home Depot has been one of the fastest-growing retailers, and also one of the best stocks, since its first store opened in 1979.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Home Depot's paid regular quarterly dividends for more than 20 years since initiating payment in 1992. However, Home Depot's 22-year dividend streak can't hold a candle to Target, whose dividend history dates all the way back to 1967. Target's uninterrupted quarterly dividend-streak of 46 years allows it to win the endurance crown without breaking a sweat.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Home Depot's dividend payouts held firm between 2006 and 2009, which means that it's only been raising its dividend since 2010. By contrast, Target has been raising its dividend payouts since 1968, which equates to a 45-year long dividend-raising streak, according to dividend.com. This one was even more lopsided than the first contest.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Home Depot has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as the U.S. housing market has barely begun to recover from a once-in-a-lifetime crash. Increasing consumer home-improvement spending and strong housing starts have already fueled a double in Home Depot's shares over the past two years. On the other hand, Target has been expanding its geographical presence as well as product offerings, but it's been crimped by an ongoing retail malaise, and a long-running shift toward online retail has barely begun to impact larger brick-and-mortar retailers. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others.

Conversely, even if Obamacare were to somehow fail, insurers such as WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group had incredible pricing power long before this new health reform law was enacted.|Also, with respect to UnitedHealth, which gets about one-quarter of its business from Medicare Advantage -- a supplemental health insurance plan that helps bridge the costs paid out of pocket by Medicare patients -- it would probably see growth in its Medicare Advantage business no matter which scenario ensues.

The big-box retailer has announced it will open at 6:00pm on Thanksgiving, two hours earlier than last year, in order to boost consumer traffic and sales revenue. The retailer will remain open throughout the evening and into Black Friday since over 4,000 of their U.S. stores are regularly open 24 hours. In addition, Wal-Mart will offer special deals on must-have items this holiday season through their website beginning Thanksgiving morning. This newest Thanksgiving strategy of offering deals even earlier than usual may seem like a win-win for Wal-Mart, but its competitors are also gearing up for the holiday season. Plus, more time to shop on Thanksgiving does not guarantee that consumers will spend more than their wallets will allow.|It's going to be a nuclear arms raceWal-Mart's actions will not be taken lightly by competitors. Once one retailer makes a bold sales move to draw attention and traffic its way, other retailers must respond in a similar fashion. This move by Walmart to open doors earlier on Thanksgiving, increasing its number of popular items on hand, and starting sales promotions a month earlier on-line will force its competitors to modify their strategy in each of these areas. Wal-Mart's move has started what some may call an "arms race." Retailers are going to closely take note of what the others are doing, mimicking every move by their competitors in order to remain strong on the battlefield. Since the holiday season is six days shorter than last year, retailers are worried that less shopping time for consumers could result in a decrease in sales. Retailers, like Wal-Mart, are pulling out all the stops to not let this holiday season be a letdown.|This means war!Like Wal-Mart, its competitors are also opening doors earlier on Thanksgiving. BestBuy will open its doors at the same time as Wal-Mart in an attempt to lure consumers towards their assortment of electronics. Target, Macy's (NYSE: M) , Kohl's, and J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) will open their doors at 8:00 pm on Thanksgiving. For Macy's and JC Penny, this is their first time being open on Thanksgiving. Macy's and JC Penny had to make this change if they plan on having any sort of sales victory, especially in J.C. Penney's case. Like J.C. Penney, Sears is also hurting sales-wise at both Sears and Kmart. Hoping to recover and make up for lost ground, Sears plans to kick-off Black Friday sales before all the rest by opening all Kmarts' doors at 6:00 am on Thanksgiving. Not only are retailers' opening their doors earlier than in past years, but they also have sales promotions scheduled to run hours, days, and weeks up until Thanksgiving and through the Black Friday weekend.|Sales promotions and hot-ticket items available for consumers have increased this holiday season. Wal-Mart, in fact, has already released its online annual sales promotions, hoping to generate holiday sales a month earlier. In addition, Wal-Mart will have 65% more televisions available to purchase, along with twice as many tablet computers and an additional 17 must-have consumer products on display throughout the store. Wal-Mart will release special deals on these items at different times throughout the evening on Thanksgiving and into Black Friday. Like Wal-Mart, Target is advertising a special daily promotion starting two weeks before Thanksgiving, whereas Best Buy and Kohl's plan to offer online deals for a few days|No retailer is expected to boost revenues by that much this year. For instance, Wal-Mart is expected to increase revenues by 3% year over year, and Best Buy is expected to actually experience a 10.4% decrease in revenues from the same quarter last year. Other retailers like Kohl's, Target, and J.C. Penney are not looking any better than last holiday season, with Kohl's seeing an estimated decrease in revenues of -2.6%, Target by -1.3%, and J.C. Penney increasing revenues by less than half a percent. As far as earnings per share goes, analysts expect Best Buy to increase EPS by $0.11, with the other retailers gaining or losing a negligible $0.02 to $0.04 per share. However, for J.C. Penney, analysts expect the company to lose $0.91 per share, which is better than last fourth quarter when they lost $1.95 per share. For J.C. Penney, this holiday season is their make it or break it quarter.

Today, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) , two companies that have come to symbolize different aspects of the new globalized retail economy, will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeFounded in 1962, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is the world's largest retailer, and ranked as the world's second-largest public corporation on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2013. The company operates more than 11,000 stores under 69 banners in 27 countries, and also maintains e-commerce websites in 10 countries. The Arkansas-based colossus is perhaps more responsible than any other company for changing the way America shops, as its supply chain advancements have helped set the standard for globally-oriented retail operations for decades. However, Wal-Mart has also become a symbol of the purported evils of globalism, as these same supply chain advancements have spurred the growth of sweatshop labor in the developing world while simultaneously crowding smaller local retail enterprises out of many communities.|Founded in 1907, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) is the world's largest package-delivery company by revenue and volume, and is a global supply chain leader, making it an ideal complement to Wal-Mart's retail operations. UPS delivers roughly 1.8 million packages each business day to over 200 countries and territories. and also provides supply chain solutions to customers in over 175 countries and territories. In its last few decades, UPS has expanded enormously through the acquisition of nearly 40 companies, which have included retail shipping services, trucking and air freight, and international trade services.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)Wal-Mart is one of investors' favorite dividend stocks because it's paid uninterrupted dividends for a period of 39 years since initiating payment in 1974. That's an easy win for Wal-Mart over UPS, which only began paying quarterly dividends in 1999, according to Dividata.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak)According to Dividata, UPS has been increasing its dividend at least once per year since 2010, after holding steady in 2009 during the global financial crisis. On the other hand, Wal-Mart has raised its dividend payments every year since 1975, which works out to 38-year dividend-raising streak. This is even more lopsided in Wal-Mart's favor than the first contest.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Wal-Mart may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Wal-Mart has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as its aggressive expansion plans in emerging markets have helped offset domestic weakness. However, the company's once-indomitable supply chain advantage has eroded, and a shift to online retail could ultimately tip UPS into the lead as more consumers decide that they'd rather have their purchases delivered from a nearby warehouse instead of bagged up at a checkout line. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others.

Monsanto, DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Syngenta (NYSE: SYT) all provide the one major purchased component that all crop farmers need: seeds with which to grow their crops. Beyond the planting, there is plenty of discrepancy on the other inputs from pesticides to fertilizers, but the seed is the one absolute investment requirement for crop farmers.|Monsanto's contributions came late, but have since spurred a second agricultural revolution. The commercialization of Roundup herbicide in 1976 and the subsequent introduction of Roundup Ready Soybeans twenty years later changed the playing field. Monsanto's Roundup Ready Seeds and the Pioneer Hi-Bred products now owned by DuPont were created in response to farmer demand, with farmers seeking to get the highest yields from their crops. Seeds have since become an absolute consumable, and farmers' dependence on Roundup translated into Monsanto seeds being a no-brain decision.|Why Monsanto is making a climate move Increasing crop productivity is Monsanto's (and DuPont's and Syngenta's) business. Like the productivity-increasing agriculture products of the twentieth century, Monsanto sees the weather-predicting prowess of The Climate Corporation as not only a tool to help increase crop productivity, but also as a business capable of producing substantial annual returns. Monsanto may be taking what looks like a huge $1 billion risk on the acquisition, but the move makes complete sense if one looks closer at what Monsanto has been developing beyond just seeds and pesticides.|Sunny skies ahead Monsanto is mostly alone in taking a direct approach to address the effects of climate conditions on agricultural productivity. Syngenta and DuPont create and are developing products to withstand extreme environments, but Monsanto's investment to provide farmers with tools that may reduce weather-related risks is a direct and forward-looking approach that will pay off for Monsanto.

The company, which happens to be the second-largest player in home-improvement retail with a market capitalization of $49.8 billion, second only to Home Depot (NYSE: HD) with a market capitalization of $114.2 billion.|After such a tremendous fall, investors should ask themselves if Lowe's is a buy now or if more trouble lies ahead. To answer this question, I delved into its earnings report and compared it to Home Depot.|Lowe's vs. Home DepotThis week, Home Depot also reported earnings. Much to Mr. Market's surprise, the company earned $0.95 per share, 5.6% higher than the $0.90 that analysts expected and substantially higher than the $0.63 it earned last year. The increase in the company's bottom line came about as a result of revenue increasing 7.4% (due to an increase in comparable-store sales of 7.4%) combined with greater cost savings.|For the quarter, Home Depot saw its COGS decline from 65.4% of sales to 65.1%. On top of this improvement, it also experienced a substantial decline in its SG&A expenses, which fell from 22.8% of sales to 21%. Additionally, investors benefited from 81 million fewer shares outstanding, without which earnings per share would have fallen inline with analyst expectations.|Foolish takeawayLooking at the performance of both Lowe's and Home Depot, we can see that neither company appears to be performing poorly. Rather, each entity is growing at a nice pace for their size and they are driving higher returns for shareholders due to cost containment and share buybacks. Furthermore, it would be a misstatement to say that Lowe's reported poor earnings for the quarter.|What the market seems to be doing here is punishing the company unjustifiably, not because it failed to meet earnings but because it did not beat forecasts like its larger rival, Home Depot. As such, this could provide the Foolish investor who believes Lowe's offers a good value proposition an opportunity to buy in at what they may perceive to be a discount.|To bad the market doesn't shop. We have both stores here in town within a quarter mile of each other. Lowe's employees are helpful, cordial, and knowledgeable. Home Depot employees are outwardly disgruntled. The Lowe's store is well stocked with good selections. The Home Depot store has cut item after item from the shelf. Home Depot has moved toward bulk packaging many items pricing themselves out of the DIY/Handyman arena. Wall street, get out and shop.

The Nike swoosh is one of the most recognizable brand logos in the world, and this has important implications for the company from both a strategic and financial point of view.|Brand differentiation, a reputation for quality and a strong focus on innovation allow Nike to benefit from superior pricing power and this, in combination with scale advantages, means higher profit margins for shareholders. Nike has an operating margin of 13.8% of sales versus an industry average of 10.9% according to data from Morningstar.|Nike operates in a discretionary consumer business and this can be a source of volatility in times of economic hurdles.

Pfizer's test group is even bigger than Sanofi and Regeneron's, at 22,000 patients, and tests RN-316 on patients with a wide variety of cholesterol levels.|Pfizer's study has two main stages -- the first study will see if RN-316 can help patients whose levels of LDL cholesterol cannot be effectively reduced by statins alone. The second study will attempt to reduce LDL cholesterol to levels lower than competing treatments.|Pfizer clearly believes that RN-316 could be its ticket back into the cholesterol treatment market, which could be a positive catalyst for the company, considering that its former top-selling statin Lipitor only generated $533 million in revenue last quarter -- a 29% drop from the prior-year quarter.

In these licensed territories, Coca-Cola Enterprises provides Coca-Cola, Fanta, Capri-Sun, Schweppes, Dr Pepper, Monster, Relentless, and PowerAde. What's interesting about Coca-Cola Enterprises's third-quarter performance is that the volume numbers appear to be moving in the opposite direction from industry trends for sparkling and still beverages, but there's a reason for this.|Recent resultsPrior to going over recent volume performance, it should be noted that the rise of the health-conscious consumer has led to declining demand for sparkling beverages (soda). Also thanks to the rise of the health-conscious consumer, demand for still beverages (juices, ready-to-drink teas, etc.) has increased. However, that wasn't the case for Coca-Cola Enterprises in the third quarter.|In the third quarter, volume increased 2.5% year over year, with sparkling beverage volume popping 4% and still beverage volume sliding 5%. Coca-Cola trademark beverage brand volume jumped 5%, with strong growth in Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero, Cherry Coke Zero, and Vanilla Coke. A lot of this success has to do with Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) status as a marketing juggernaut.|It doesn't seem to matter what headwinds are thrown at Coca-Cola. It will find a way to offset those headwinds. For instance, Coca-Cola's "Share a Coke" program has been a continued success and its international potential is still in its infant stages. If you would like an example of the "Share a Coke" program, you can watch this short video: http://youtu.be/5l0cCyElfgg|Even the CIA is helping Coca-Cola. No ... undercover spies aren't tapping into phones and watching potential customers with night-vision goggles. This is a different CIA -- the Culinary Institute of America. Researchers at this CIA help determine what meals best complement Coca-Cola. This information is then passed on to certain quick-service and full-service restaurants. The idea here is to enhance the customer experience for these restaurants. While many consumers have a beverage of choice, others will select a drink based on their mood. This program can help lead customers in the right direction in order to maximize their meal experience.|Still beverages should bounce back, and Coca-Cola has proven that it has the capability to drive demand for sparkling beverages with its marketing power. This is a positive for Coca-Cola Enterprises. There is also good potential in emerging markets as these consumers aren't as health-conscious as Americans. At least not yet.|While Coca-Cola Enterprises is a quality operation, it lags PepsiCo on the top line, it comes up short of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo at turning revenue into profit, and its yield isn't quite as impressive as Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.|When you compare Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, as always, it seems like somewhat of a wash. While PepsiCo is performing better on the top line, Coca-Cola is more impressive in profit margin, yield, and debt-to-equity ratio. However, debt isn't really a concern for any of these companies, since they generate so much cash. In other words, they're capable of paying down those debts.|Coca-Cola might be a marketing juggernaut, but if you're looking for resiliency then PepsiCo might be a slightly better option thanks to its broad product diversification.|Coca-Cola makes this list, but so do two other companiesIf you're looking for some long-term investing ideas, you're invited to check out The Motley Fool's brand-new special report, "The 3 Dow Stocks Dividend Investors Need."

Negative headwinds from Aspartame concerns and the general downtrend in carbonated sodas weighed in on the company. Overall, reported sales increased 1% on the basis of price with overall sales volume declining 1% in the most recent quarter. The five tidbits listed below will help you understand Dr. Pepper Snapple Group's current direction amid towering competition from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) .|Reported top-line growth for the big three beverage companies ranked in the dismal range. Coca-Cola's revenue actually declined 3% in its most recent quarter. Its global sparkling volume expanded a mere 1% versus 3% for non-carbonated beverages. Currency headwinds and restructurings further contributed to Coca-Cola's woes. According to fellow Fool Ted Cooper , Coca-Cola commands more than 40% of the carbonated soda market in North America meaning it still maintains a huge ubiquitous advantage over the other two companies and commands great pricing and distribution power. Coca-Cola is also moving forward with expansion plans in emerging markets.

As a testament to the enormity of what the company has become, I decided that now might be a good time for the Foolish investor to learn some interesting details about the world's largest soft drink provider.|Coca-Cola serves... a lot!As a large company, it's not hard to imagine that Coca-Cola sells a lot of products every year. However, you might be surprised about how much. According to research, Coca-Cola serves 1.7 billion servings (inclusive of all of its 500 brands across at least 200 countries) every day. Stacked up against the roughly 50 billion servings of beverages globally, this comprises 3.4% of all servings drank.|In response to this lack of support, John Austin, Coke's Chairman and CEO at the time, met with the mayor of the city and top businessmen. In a frank manner, he said, "It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located in a city that refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Co. does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Co." Following this short speech, tickets for the event sold out in only two hours, which suggests that maybe we should use the head of Coca-Cola more often for political controversies today.|In 2006, three individuals (one of whom was an employee at Coca-Cola) were arrested on charges of stealing and attempting to sell trade secrets. According to one news source, the defendants contacted PepsiCo and offered to sell it documents, as well as a vial of an experimental Coca-Cola drink, for $1.5 million. Instead of taking them up on the offer, PepsiCo notified a Coca-Cola employee of the breach who, in turn, brought in the FBI for a sting operation.|The world of Coca-ColaApparently, it wasn't enough for Coca-Cola to take over the beverage industry, because it has now jumped into the world of tourism. In Atlanta there exists the World of Coca-Cola, a museum and exhibition about the company. Included in the exhibit is a variety of original artwork from professional painters like Norman Rockwell, and a vault experience that talks about the company's secret formula.|On top of these experiences, the World of Coca-Cola includes a 42-foot high bottle from Sky Field made of more than 11,000 pieces of authentic Atlanta Braves equipment. Finally, the location has a large fountain machine called Coca-Cola Freestyle that allows visitors to try more than 100 different drink combinations.

However, Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives twice quelled analysts' concern about Britvic's possible gain in market share by saying Coca-Cola Enterprises gained year-to-date volume and value share in Europe.|Marketing and weather gave the company a boostThe vast majority of volume growth came from brand Coca-Cola. Regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero increased volume 4% and 23% respectively. Other Coca-Cola flavors, a category that include Vanilla Coke and Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, increased volume 10%. Marketing campaigns such as the "Share-a-Coke" program where people can purchase a can of Coke with their name as well as the "Coke with Meals" program where Coca-Cola products gets marketed with food, in addition to temporarily favorable weather conditions in the month of July contributed greatly to the volume increases.|European economy remains poorDespite an improving GDP, Coca-Cola Enterprises faces tough macroeconomic headwinds in the form of continued high unemployment and a cash strapped consumer that wants to sit on their wallet. The ravages of the various sovereign debt crises and a steep recession still remain on the minds of the European populace. Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives expect growth to remain low to flat in the near term and the weather conditions and the effects from its marketing campaign that caused the uptick in volume and revenue experienced in the most recent quarter will not remain.|Still beverages faced tough comparisonsInterestingly, Coca-Cola Enterprises' still beverages actually performed worse than sparkling with volume declining 5%. This stems from difficult comparisons to the same time last year when still beverages grew in the double digits probably due to the Olympics in London. Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives downplayed its weakness in bottled water saying that it only comprised 3% of sales.|Diets not a problemWhile diet soda volume and sales continue to suffer here in the United States due to aspartame fears Coca-Cola Enterprises reports no such declines at least not yet. Coca-Cola Enterprises' CFO Hubert Patricot said that diet sodas "continue to grow very fast" and "outperformed the regular portfolio" in the most recent quarter.|Foolish takeawayCoca-Cola Enterprises trades at 19 times earnings right on par with the S&P 500 and a little less than Coca-Cola's P/E of 21. Regardless of the negative sentiment by Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives and the market in general, evidence points to pockets of recovery in Europe. Eventually European unemployment will begin to trend downward resulting in increased consumer spending. If this happens Coca-Cola Enterprises' revenue and free cash flow will accelerate translating into capital gains and dividend increases. Currently Coca-Cola Enterprises yields $0.80 per share yielding 1.9%. Coca-Cola Enterprises may represent a long-term turnaround play.

Retailers say they're only providing what the consumers want, but it's certainly not what I want, and I imagine there are quite a few people who feel the same way.

However, this wasn't always the case. The company, which was founded in 1923, began as a small operation that would eventually transform into the giant that it is today. To celebrate the company's standing as the creme de la creme of media, I thought it only fitting to write an article about three things you probably didn't know about it.|Walt was wrong; it didn't start with a mouseMost people who are fans of Disney will likely recall Walt Disney's famous saying: "I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing-that it was all started by a mouse". Although it is true that the company's early success came about as a result of the introduction of Mickey Mouse, it's far from true that Disney's work started with the mouse.|Disney had a predecessorPrior to starting Disney, Walt set up and ran another animation studio. In 1922, Walt founded Laugh-O-Gram Films with an initial $15,000 investment. Their primary function was to produce fairy tale cartoons for Pictorial Clubs. Despite this profitable contract, which brought in $11,000 for the studio, the company struggled to pay its bills. In 1923 it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the collapse of Pictorial Clubs.|However, before the studio was shut down Laugh-O-Gram successfully produced two other projects; Tommy Tucker's Tooth and Alice's Wonderland. The first film talked about the virtues of brushing your teeth and the negative consequences if you don't care for them properly. The second film, Alice's Wonderland, came about as a result of Walt reinvesting the $500 he had made from Tommy Tucker's Tooth. It was this second film that would lead to the earliest commercial success for Disney's Alice Comedies.|The original location of Laugh-O-Gram, which is located in Kansas City, Missouri and which served as the birthplace of Mickey Mouse, fell into disrepair after many years. However, in recent years a non-profit group named "Thank You, Walt Disney" in collaboration with Disney has worked to restore the building and turn it into a museum and education center focusing on animation.

My conclusion was that the energy supermajor's "return on capital remains well in excess of [its] cost of capital" and that it "does not need to deliver the same returns it has produced since 1970 (a better than 375-fold total return) in order to provide investors with a more than adequate return during the next 40 years."|This morning, research firm Morningstar published a detailed analysis supporting its decision to continue awarding a "wide moat" rating to ExxonMobil -- the only such rating among the oil and gas producers it covers (a "wide moat" refers to long-term competitive advantage -- a key source of excess returns). The full report, which can be found here, is required reading if you own or are considering buying ExxonMobil shares, but I've highlighted some of the key points below.|Chanos argued ExxonMobil a "value trap" on the basis that:|In terms of the integrated oil companies, the business demonstrably has gotten worse and it's for a simple reason: the cost of finding and replacing reserves has gone up. Let's just use Exxon as an example. Their revenues are down year-over-year yet the amount of capital they've employed in the business continues to grow.|Like its peers, Exxon has seen its F&D [finding & development] costs rise during the past 10 years. However, relative to commodity prices and measured against peers, Exxon remains highly competitive. F&D costs for Exxon have remained relatively stable during the past 10 years despite increasing in absolute terms. If we look at Exxon's F&D as a percentage of oil prices, it has actually fallen.|However, that measure ignores the shift toward natural gas in the reserve base. Measuring F&D as part of revenue per barrel of oil equivalent of production, however, takes into account the shift to natural gas as percentage of reserves and production during the past 10 years. By that measure, Exxon still appears competitive, suggesting it should continue delivering excess returns on capital in its upstream segment... Compared with peers, Exxon continues to replace reserves at a competitive cost. In fact, it has registered improvement since 2009.|Exxon's low cost of capital plays a part in its wide moat rating. Although not the lowest of its peer group, it still provides a low hurdle rate to earn excess returns. Combined with higher returns on capital, Exxon generates greater excess returns. This wide spread between returns on invested capital and the weighted average cost of capital, or the size of the excess returns relative to peers', gives us confidence in Exxon's ability to generate excess returns for 20 years, earning it a wide moat. The magnitude of peers' excess returns is less, providing less of a margin of safety and earning them only narrow moats.|That paragraph reads like a ringing endorsement of Buffett's decision to add ExxonMobil to Berkshire's portfolio and the one to reduce the existing ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) position. However, I should note that Morningstar currently rates ExxonMobil as a three-star stock, which, according to their methodology, indicates that the current stock price is close to their fair value estimate and that the stock "should offer a "fair return," one that compensates for the riskiness of the stock." The Oracle of Omaha likes to make investments in the expectation that they will earn a return that's more than fair, but, given the size of Berkshire's portfolio, "fair" would hardly be a shameful result.

With an ongoing battle between those seeing better times ahead for the economy and those pointing to the need for a correction in the long-running bull market, the tension could keep stocks from moving much in either direction until a resolution arrives. Still, individual stocks provided some substantial moves, as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) fell while Boeing (NYSE: BA) climbed.|Home Depot declined by 1%. Interest rates have started to rise again during the Dow run-up, continuing a trend that started during the spring. With investors continuing to be nervous about the possible impact of rising rates on the housing market, and therefore on home-improvement efforts, Home Depot might once again need to demonstrate its ability to provide stronger growth even without the tailwinds of sharp growth in home prices helping push its sales upward.

This morning, I pointed out a few of the laggards, but despite those losers, one of the Dow's biggest retail stocks, Nike (NYSE: NKE) , rose 1% this afternoon. The move came after the athletic apparel company announced that its board of directors approved an increase to the company's quarterly dividend. The previous quarterly amount was increased from $0.21 to $0.24, which represents a 14% jump. This increase marks the 12th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend and, despite the fact that its current yield is only 1.1%, the dividend amount has increased by 800% since Nike began its yearly dividend increases. While most investors don't consider Nike a slow-growing dividend-paying stock today, it should be seen as a good thing. Even though the dividend has been increased 12 consecutive years and by 800%, it only yields a little over 1%, which means the price appreciation is still good. From where I am sitting, that is a win-win scenario, and investors should consider Nike when looking for new stocks.|The Motley Fool recommends Amazon.com, FedEx, Nike, The Fresh Market, and United Parcel Service.

By investing in these companies, you also receive generous dividend payments. In my opinion, there would be little reason to choose Energizer Holdings over Colgate-Palmolive or Procter & Gamble, unless you're simply looking for stock appreciation momentum.

Airbus made its own mark too, with Etihad taking on 50 A350s and 36 A320s, plus the purchase rights for a further 30, an order totaling $26.9 billion. Emirates' announced that it was ordering an additional 50 A380s, bringing the Emirates fleet of the double-decker plane to 140.|For Peter Morris. chief economist at Ascend, Boeing's focus on size is the right one. "The 'right sizing' of the aircraft is the most important factor. Range/distance capability is a relevant factor for very few routes. Indeed, where an aircraft built for long range use is used on shorter or medium distances, it will be carrying a lot of unnecessary structural weight."|Still, John Strickland, director at JLS Consulting, said it's not appropriate to talk about winners and losers in the battle for orders. "In terms of profile, Boeing got the upper hand with all these orders for the 777X and a chunky order for 737s from flydubai," Strickland told CNBC. "Airbus would have been, to a degree, relieved by the big order for the A380 double-decker from Emirates which puts that program on a firmer footing."

The customers include Emirates, 150 aircraft; Qatar Airways, 50 aircraft; and Etihad Airways, 25 aircraft. A fourth 777 customer, Lufthansa, previously ordered 34 aircraft.|Moreover, experts said, Boeing's orders represent a zero sum game because many of the passengers who fly on the new aircraft will come from European airlines who are current Boeing customers. Those carriers, theoretically, will now order fewer new planes.|Boeing spokesman Tim Neale said that with continuing strong traffic growth in Asia and the Middle East, "there is a real demand out there for air travel and air shipments that can benefit all airlines -- So I don't agree that this is a zero sum game." Also, in a position paper, Emirates maintained that while it is state-owned it receives no state subsidies or funding, and in fact pays dividends to the Dubai government.|ALPA and A4A issued statements saying the orders by Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and Flydubai for Airbus and Boeing aircraft total $162.2 billion. "These state-owned foreign airlines are spending billions to purchase widebody aircraft so they can increase flights to and from the United States and unfairly compete against U.S. airlines in the global marketplace," said ALPA President Lee Moak, in a prepared statement.|Unlike state-owned Middle East airlines, U.S. airlines often face government-imposed obstacles. They carry an extremely high tax burden, while foreign competitors often operate largely tax-free. The U.S. plans a U.S. Customs preclearance facility in Abu Dhabi, even though no U.S. carriers fly to Abu Dhabi. And the Export-Import Bank often subsidizes the purchase of Boeing aircraft by foreign carriers, including both Emirates and Etihad, but no one subsidizes U.S. airline aircraft purchases from Airbus or Boeing.|Boeing's Neale said he expects the carriers will likely fund the planes in the commercial financing market rather than rely on the Ex-Im Bank. Not only has "Middle East carriers' use of export credit has been below the historic global average," Neale said, but also "the cost of government export credit doubled earlier this year and is now in line with what's available from commercial lenders without government loan guarantees. In fact, U.S. airlines have been getting better rates this year in the commercial bond market than foreign airlines have been getting using government export credit."

Yet no component on the Dow even has come close to sniffing Boeing's (NYSE: BA) unrivaled year. Boeing's stock has blown up by nearly 80% as the world's preeminent aerospace manufacturer has rallied despite a major setback to kick off 2013. What's Boeing done to succeed? Let's look back at this company's rise this year.|Blue skies for Boeing's airlinersBoeing's sales have lifted off without any hint of turbulence this year, gaining more than 5% year to date through the first nine months of 2013. That might not seem like a lot, but for a company of Boeing's size, it's an impressive figure. The company's operating earnings have jumped even more, gaining more than 8% through that time, so it's not as if Boeing isn't making good use of its new business.|Yet that hasn't stopped Boeing's civilian aircraft business at all. Granted, Boeing's trusty 737 line of airliners has been the big winner so far in 2013, but the company's soared above rival EADS' (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) Airbus in its ability to swallow up orders. Boeing scored more than $100 billion in total new aircraft orders at June's Paris Air Show less than two months after the FAA cleared the air of the 787's grounding, including a huge order from Ryanair for 175 737-800s.|Just this week, Boeing added to its monster year for civilian aircraft by racking up another near-$100 billion order haul at the Dubai Air Show. Boeing's 777 line of aircraft impressed buyers in the Middle East, and the company blew by Airbus, which pulled in only around $40 billion in new orders.|However, it hasn't all been good news for Boeing against its top rival. Airbus outsold Boeing in October, and the company's outsold Boeing through the year as well. Still, with civilian aircraft sales up 9.5% year over year through the first nine months of 2013 and segment operating margins jumping to double-digit percentages, Boeing investors hardly have reason to complain about the firm's dominant airliner business.|The defense gives groundBoeing's military aircraft segment hasn't performed quite so well. This was to be expected: After all, sequestration's budget cuts have come down especially hard on the Pentagon, making life tougher for defense contractors in 2013 and going forward.|The company's defense, space, and security unit's revenues climbed meekly through the first nine months of the year, but Boeing's contractual backlog has fallen by around 8% in this unit. Furthermore, sales have slipped at its military aircraft unit, the largest division of this business, and military aircraft operating margins fell nearly an entire percentage point to 8.9% as compared to last year.|Boeing's 2013 for its military division took its hardest hit back in September. It seemed to be the odds-on favorite to win South Korea's fighter jet competition with its F-15SE Silent Eagle. South Korea offered $7.7 billion for the contract, and both Eurofighter's Typhoon and Lockheed-Martin's (NYSE: LMT) F-35 ran over budget. Boeing had no competitor left standing in its way.|Then things took an unexpected twist as South Korea's military leadership deemed the F-15SE as unsuitable for protecting the country against North Korea and other attackers, opting instead to reopen the competition. It was a stinging blow for Boeing, especially now that Lockheed's back in the game with the F-35, a costlier but more advanced aircraft that seems the likely favorite to supply the Korean military.|That won't help Boeing's military division get back on track. However, the company's operations in orbit have performed much better: Its network and space systems branch has managed nearly 6% sales growth through the year's first nine months and has grown its operating margin by more than half a percentage point. It's only around half the size of Boeing's military aircraft business, but this segment's growth has been a key reason that its total defense, space, and security business has managed to gain ground this year.|More to come from Boeing?All in all, the success of Boeing's soaring civilian aircraft business has outweighed the pressure and missed opportunities from the company's military aircraft segment. Boeing's total backlog continues to rise, and the 787's emergence from the grounding delay relatively unscathed has maintained optimism in the company's flagship airliner.|2013's been a good year for Boeing, but if it can keep up the momentum it's captured this year, this stock's run might be just getting started for investors.|Don't wait to jump-start your financial futureBoeing's gains have been just one part of the Dow's huge rise in 2013, but have you made the most of the stock market's boom? Millions of Americans have waited on the sidelines since the market meltdown in 2008 and 2009, too scared to invest and put their money at further risk.

You can break Caterpillar's business down into three main segments: construction industries, power systems, and resource industries. The latter segment focuses on making equipment for mining industries and has been the main reason for the company's decline. The good news is that there may be a reason for long-term investors to stick around.|Caterpillar's third-quarter earnings took a 44% nosedive and aren't looking to improve over the near term. Looking at sales in three month chunks, at the end of the third quarter, its sales of machinery and power systems had declined 9% and 2%, respectively. For the three-month period ended October 31, Caterpillar posted a 12% decline in machinery sales and a 9% decline in power systems -- an uninspiring result.|Photo credit: Caterpillar.|"This year has proven to be difficult, with expected sales and revenues nearly $11 billion lower than last year. That is a 17% decline from 2012, with about 75% of the drop from Resource Industries, which is principally mining. We expect Resource Industries to be down close to 40% for the full year and Power Systems' and Construction Industries' sales to each be down about 5%," said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman in the third-quarter presentation.|Caterpillar's sales in its Asia-Pacific region were hit the hardest, with a 26% decline in machinery sales in the three months ended October 31. Europe also witnessed a 14% slide while Africa and the Middle East posted a 9% drop.|While Caterpillar expects there to be global growth in 2014, it stopped short of expecting any improvement in earnings. Until there's substantial growth, Caterpillar will be forced to continue its cost-cutting efforts.|Caterpillar will likely continue to slash jobs until demand returns. It recently announced it will be closing its Pulaski, Va., mining equipment facility and will move the operation to its Pennsylvania facility -- a loss of 240 jobs. That's in addition to the more than 13,000 jobs already cut by Caterpillar globally.|Also, with Caterpillar losing significant sales in the Asia-Pacific region, it will have its work cut out for it to regain sales in China, where it trails Komatsu -- a rare second place for Caterpillar. Caterpillar is heavily exposed to the mining end market, which has faced shrinking demand as China's economic activity continues to move at a historically slow pace.|While it's definitely ugly for Caterpillar investors right now, and the near term looks just as dark, there is upside remaining for long-term investors.|The upsideFirstly, Caterpillar has a strong dealer network with a great reputation for high quality, which minimizes customer downtime -- a critical factor for customers. Also, as the world's largest construction and mining equipment manufacturer, its economies of scale is second to none. As the global economic recovery slowly continues, it should provide stronger demand equipment demand for Caterpillar in the medium to long term. This is especially true if China resumes a faster growth pace than we've seen over the past year and Europe continues to come back from its rock-bottom economic situation.|Secondly, while the near term does indeed look frightful, Caterpillar has consistently returned value to shareholders, which could give investors enough reason to jump in for the long haul. Consider that even during this rough patch, the company has increased its dividend by 15% in the second quarter, and repurchased $2 billion of common stock this year. This appears to be sustainable as Caterpillar expects this year's cash flow to be the second best in its history. If you believe the slow-but-sure global economic recovery will continue, Caterpillar is an intriguing long-term investment -- it at least belongs on your watchlist through 2014 while the situation continues to unfold.|Dividend stocks like Caterpillar can make you richIt's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine. With this in mind, our analysts sat down to identify the absolute best of the best when it comes to rock-solid dividend stocks, drawing up a list in this free report of nine that fit the bill.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up almost 23%. Some may think this looks like an opportunity to pick up shares of Caterpillar on the cheap, but there are good reasons for the price weakness.|Big, yellow, and familiarCaterpillar is a $53 billion heavy equipment manufacturer based in the US. According to brand management firm Interbrand, Caterpillar is among the 100 most valuable brands in the world. People everywhere recognize the big, yellow trucks that Caterpillar is known for, and that kind of familiarity can be comforting for investors.|Comforting or not, Caterpillar has had its share of troubles lately. According to Reuters, the company recently shut down or downsized seven manufacturing facilities, including laying off 900 employees while restructuring two large plants in Illinois and Wisconsin.|What Caterpillar is choking onOver the past few years, Caterpillar stepped up its presence in emerging markets, specifically in mining. Strategically, that made sense. According to Morningstar, mining equipment is one of the most profitable segments for Caterpillar and it also represents about one-third of the company's revenue.|However, Caterpillar may have bitten off more than it could chew. In 2010, Caterpillar acquired Bucyrus International, a U.S.-based manufacturer of mining equipment with established relationships in emerging markets. Shortly afterward, Caterpillar also acquired ERA Holdings, a China-based manufacturer of mining equipment.|How did those moves work out? According to Forbes, the ERA transaction was tarnished by alleged fraud. Last year, Caterpillar announced almost $600 million in losses tied to the purchase. The writedowns appear to stem from years of inappropriate accounting practices at the Chinese company.|Though the Bucyrus transaction was free from fraud, it was poorly timed. At $7.6 billion, the acquisition was substantial and one of the largest in Caterpillar's history. Unfortunately, since the deal closed, economic activity has steadily slowed in China, a trend that is expected to continue. The chart below shows annual GDP growth for China from 2010-2016 (2013-2016 are estimates).|As expected, mining activity has also slowed in the region, which has affected Caterpillar's bottom line. In October, the company reported earnings that trailed the average analyst estimates. In addition, Caterpillar also gave cautious guidance and lowered its outlook for 2014.|Keeping Caterpillar companyFor what it's worth, Caterpillar's wasn't the only company champing at the China bit. Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) , a mining equipment company based in the US, and a competitor with Caterpillar's mining business, acquired China-based International Mining Machinery in 2011. Joy estimated the cost to be about $1.4 billion -- a big bet, since Joy's market capitalization is only about $6 billion.|While Joy and Caterpillar are racing to get ahead in emerging markets, they still trail Komatsu (NASDAQOTH: KMTUY) a $20 billion company based in Japan. Komatsu is the world's second-largest heavy equipment manufacturer (after Caterpillar), but is the frontrunner in key emerging markets. Local to Asia with almost a century of history, Komatsu enjoys a home-court advantage, and it's established operations in China, India, and Thailand.|By the numbersDespite Caterpillar's recent troubles, some may think it's a good value at $83. Based on the numbers, I disagree. The table below shows some key financial measures for Caterpillar versus its industry:|Caterpillar|Caterpillar looks relatively unattractive in terms of growth, valuation, and financial condition. While Caterpillar's price-to-earnings ratio of 15.9 times isn't high in absolute terms, it's two times the industry average. Also, notice that Caterpillar's quick ratio is low -- only half the industry average.|The bottom lineBased on relative valuation, using an average of earnings, cash flow, and book value, I estimate fair value for Caterpillar to be about $83 per share. Thus, even following its poor price performance, the company is only now trading near fair value.|Judging by its recent missteps, cautious guidance, and relatively unimpressive fundamentals, I see no reason for Caterpillar to trade at a large premium above it's peers. All else equal, I'd want to see another 20% discount, or a price tag of $66, before considering Caterpillar a compelling buy.

Market overreaction to the earnings call resulted in the shares tanking a massive 11% on Nov.13, the day following the report. What spooked investors were the firm's expectations of lower revenue in the second-quarter by 8%-10%; analysts had expected a 4% growth. Cisco's management also expected earnings per share for the second quarter to come in lower at $0.45- $0.47 versus earlier consensus estimates of $0.52.|Earnings beatBut, was it really all doom and gloom at Cisco? Not by long stretch. Despite the headwinds, the giant networking equipment maker is facing in emerging markets, it delivered EPS of $0.53, better than analysts' expectations of $0.51, and improved its gross margins from 60.95% a year ago to 61.29%.|Most of Cisco's core businesses remain fundamentally sound, and the lower revenue guidance is a reflection of the drastic restructuring the firm is currently undertaking.|Headwinds in emerging marketsCisco's is facing major weaknesses in emerging markets. Investors are particularly worried that political tensions regarding national issues between the U.S. and China, the leading emerging market for many tech firms, is going to muddy the waters even further for Cisco.|Cisco derives about 58% of its revenue from the U.S., while emerging markets contribute about 22% of its revenue. China accounts for just 10% of its overall revenue, which in my opinion is not big enough to warrant the kind of panic we are witnessing among Cisco investors. Cisco might actually end up selling more in the U.S. if businesses here end up taking the Congressional Intelligence Committee report seriously.|Business model transitionsCisco has continued to undertake business model transitions as well as product cycle transitions under the watchful eye of CEO John Chambers. The company has, admittedly, been struggling to find regular cadence as it continues to evolve it product portfolio.|Cisco is walking away from its low-margins set-top box hardware business. The firm is also migrating its service provider video business to a recurring revenue model built around NDS' cloud computing platform. Cisco acquired NDS in 2012.|The shift from set-top boxes will be hugely beneficial to Cisco, since the industry has become fully commoditized and the risk of obsolescence is quite high. NDS gross margins trump Cisco's by a mile. Additionally, NDS has multi-year agreements that provide better revenue visibility.|Internet of ThingsCisco is in a good position to leverage its early lead in the nascent Internet of Things, or IoT, industry. The firm is one of a handful of companies that have proved to be really serious about monetizing the IoT concept. The firm recently unveiled an IoT router in September 2013. The IoT router is quite unlike the Cisco CRS core router, but rather, a network fabric designed to provide networks from centralized systems to several distributed architectures that can accommodate IoT-enabled ''things'' such as cars, homes, and various machines.|In a recent interview with the Online Barron, Cisco CEO, John Chambers, predicted the IoT will grow to a $14 trillion global industry by 2020. Other IoT growth estimates are from Intel, which projects that 3.8 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2015, and ABI Research, which predicts that 30 billion devices will be connected by 2020. Although it's still quite early to tell which figure is more accurate, indications are that Cisco might be on to something huge.|Cisco vs Microsoft: friend or foe?Cisco competes directly with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in the field of Unified Communications, or UC. Cisco's UC is facing greater competition from Microsoft's Lync, with evidence of greater adoption of Lync in recent times. Businesses that prefer Lync do so because of its easy integration into Share Point, Office, and Exchange. Microsoft's better developer environment is another big reason.|Overall, Cisco continues to be the global UC leader due its ability to leverage its huge installed VoIP base. Cisco's UC has been hailed as more mature, has a better voice quality, and, in many cases, is cheaper than Lync. A joint survey carried out by Tech Target and ZK Research in late 2012 revealed that 43% of businesses still prefer Cisco as their primary UC vendor compared to Microsoft's 26.5%.|Bottom lineAlthough Cisco is facing pressure from several quarters in the near-term, the tech firm remains a great long-term investment. The company's internal business model restructuring, and its move to consolidate its early lead in the IoT, is likely to yield huge benefits in the near future.

After all, the company is in the throes of a major conversion from its decades-old concentration on chemicals to a decided emphasis on less-cyclical agriculture.|Obviously, Monsanto (NYSE: MON) is the current model for the structure and product base toward which DuPont is moving. Not so very long ago, Monsanto was a purveyor of various sorts of chemicals. But today, virtually all its revenues are generated from the sale of agricultural items, including bioengineered seeds, pesticides, and herbicides.|DuPont is currently undergoing a similar, albeit more deliberate, transformation. In the meantime, largely because of Monsanto's total immersion in agriculture, its price-earnings multiple at 24 times is precisely twice DuPont's. Having said that, however, the St. Louis company's substantial valuation advantage may also be tied to its more robust balance sheet.|A gift to its shareholdersDuPont is working feverishly to remake itself. In 2011 it bought a major European enzyme-and-specialty-food company. And last February it unloaded its performance-coatings unit, largely the maker of automotive paint. In August it completed an arduous three-year process that resulted in the acquisition of an 80% stake in a South African seed company.|Its major effort now involves engineering the spinoff of its big but underperforming performance-chemicals segment, a task that could require up to 18 months. The unit had been thought to be a sale candidate, possibly fetching as much as $12 billion to $15 billion. But with other makers of titanium dioxide -- its primary product -- on the market, any offers that might have been received would have fallen far short of that range. Unfortunately, however, the spinoff will be far less effective than an outright sale in shrinking DuPont's $14.9 billion in total debt.|Clearly the world of Old McDonald and his peers is changing rapidly. In the process, it's beginning to revolve around data availability related to such variables as appropriate seed types, optimum planting and harvest times, weather, moisture availability, and the appropriate applications of fungicides and pesticides. The new approach is tied to all sorts of technology, including the use of global-positioning systems. On that basis, DuPont has "mapped" about 20 million acres in the past two years.|At the same time, while biotechnology and genetic engineering are less-than-popular terms in many quarters, both DuPont and Monsanto have altered the genes of the soybean to render it healthier and, more importantly, largely free of trans fats. As The New York Times pointed out not long ago, this change constitutes one of the first instances wherein genetic engineering is being used for the benefit of consumers rather than to improve the lots of farmers.|Foolish takeawayOnce its performance chemicals spinoff has been accomplished, I'd hardly be shocked if DuPont were to jettison at least some of its other segments not related to agriculture. After all, the continued inclusion of largely industrial units in the company's mix will almost certainly continue to dampen its market valuation vis-a-vis Monsanto's.|In the meantime, I'm sticking with an earlier contention that by 2015 or 2016 agriculture- and food-related units could account for as much as 75% of DuPont's revenues. That, for a company whose slogan until recently was "Better Living Through Chemistry."|Given both the major changes occurring in the company and the longtime investment saw about buying low and selling high, I'm suggesting Fools monitor the restructuring at DuPont very, very closely.|Unfortunately for DuPont's long-suffering shareholders, DuPont's sluggish Management is 10 years too late to copycat Monsanto successfully. Moreover, after years of severe cost-slashing and degrading personnel with pension benefit cancellations, forced furloughs without pay, lay-offs, firings, wage and salary freezes, sub-market rate compensation, DuPont no longer has a pool of incentivised and superior scientific and Managerial talent to accomplish the task.

Moreover, thanks to strong cost controls, Deere's earnings per share rose 20% in the fourth quarter and 19% for all of 2013. Deere's ability to thrive in the tough environment for agriculture is echoed by other industry giants. For example, poor commodity pricing didn't stop chemicals maker DuPont (NYSE: DD) or seed giant Monsanto (NYSE: MON) from producing great results this year.|DuPont's most recent quarter saw agriculture sales rise 15% driven by higher sales volumes, and overall diluted earnings are up a whopping 77% through the first nine months of the year. And, due to the strong economic drivers of the agriculture industry, DuPont believes it will produce 12% annual earnings growth for the foreseeable future.|Actually, DuPont's revenues and earnings are about to take a cliff-dive, down in the near future 20% and 29% respectively based upon full year 2012 data. DuPont Management has announced the spin-off of DuPont Performance Chemicals, including TIO2, Teflon, fluorochemicals, refrigerants, acids, which has been a steady engine of sales and cash flow. Today, Nov. 21, 2013, DuPont Management disclosed they were dumping DuPont Safety Glass, selling the business to Kuraray Co in Japan for $543 million. That means an additional big subtraction of sales and cash flow for the much shrunken and shrinking DuPont. ...funfun..

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/21/exxon-mobil-did-warren-buffett-just-invest-in-a-va.aspx|11/21/2013|0|"Exxon Mobil"|1|Last week, I highlighted three reasons why Warren Buffett boughtExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK-B) equity portfolio. (He did so in size, too -- the position was valued at $3.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.) This week, short-seller Jim Chanos, who famously bet against failed energy company Enron, offered a few reasons of his own -- for steering clear of the shares, characterizing ExxonMobil as a "value trap." Is Mr. Chanos right? Did the Oracle of Omaha just make a monumental mistake?|In terms of the integrated oil companies, the business demonstrably has gotten worse and it's for a simple reason: the cost of finding and replacing reserves has gone up. Let's just use Exxon as an example. Their revenues are down year-over-year yet the amount of capital they've employed in the business continues to grow. Their cash flow has dropped dramatically and, where in the past Exxon had been able to finance dividends and its buybacks out of free cash flow, it's no longer able to do that. It only basically finances half of that (dividends and buybacks).|Exxon used to have returns on capital of around 30% -- an amazingly profitable business. Well, it's been cut in a third in the past year. Now it's about 20%. So, it's telling you that on the margin, these companies are increasingly finding it difficult to cheaply replace reserves. And, I've basically called them 'liquidating trusts'. They're not the values they used to be. They're having now to borrow to finance a lot of the financial engineering that they're doing to keep their shares up at the same level.... It's not a value stock, it's a value trap.|I don't disagree with many of the points Chanos makes in the two paragraphs above. Many are simply factual observations one can quickly verify by looking at the company's financial results. But I disagree with his conclusion: Yes, profitability has dropped and, yes, ExxonMobil may no longer be the value it used to be. Nevertheless, a 20% return on capital remains well in excess of ExxonMobil's cost of capital. Furthermore, the company does not need to deliver the same returns it has produced since 1970 (a better than 375-fold total return) in order to provide investors with a more than adequate return during the next 40 years.|Three energy growth plays that can power your portfolioOne criticism that is often leveled at ExxonMobil: It doesn't have enough exposure to the "shale revolution," whereby record oil and natural gas production is transforming the United States' energy position. Finding the right plays while historic amounts of capital expenditures are flooding the industry will pad your investment nest egg. For this reason, the Motley Fool is offering a comprehensive look at three energy companies set to soar during this transformation in the energy industry.

Home Depot started us off with a blowout and left analysts bullish on Lowe's, who reported the next morning. However, Lowe's came out with a mixed quarter, but still showed strong growth year over year. Let's break down each report and compare the growth to last year to see who had the better third quarter and decide which company is more worthy of an investment.|The companiesHome Depot is the largest home improvement specialty retailer in the world. It currently operates 2,260 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and Guam. Lowe's is the second largest home improvement specialty retailer behind Home Depot. It has 1,831 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|Earnings per share grew 28.4% and revenue rose 7.4% compared to the third quarter in 2012. Gross profit rose 8.5%, assisted by the company's gross margin expanding by 64 basis points versus the second quarter to 34.92%. Global comparable-store sales rose an incredible 7.4%, with the U.S. showing 8.2% growth. Home Depot's chief executive officer noted continued improvement and strength in the housing market as one of the drivers for the company's success. Overall, it was an absolute blowout quarter for Home Depot and the stock has reacted accordingly.|Earnings per share increased 34.3% and revenue rose 7.3% year over year. Gross profit rose 8.2%, driven by gross margin expanding 23 basis points versus the second quarter to 34.58%. Also, global comparable-store sales grew 6.2% from the same period in 2012. Lowe's management confirmed the positive comments from Home Depot by stating, "The home improvement industry is poised for persisting growth in the fourth quarter and further acceleration in 2014." Although this was a mixed quarter, Lowe's showed strong growth year over year. This leads me to believe that the analyst estimates for Lowe's were a bit too high.|So whose report was better?Let's compare the year-over-year results from Home Depot and Lowe's and decide which company had the better third quarter:|Home Depot|Based on these six key metrics, Home Depot had the better third quarter report. With that said, Home Depot spiked to a fresh 52-week high after its report was released and currently sits just 2.6% below that mark. Lowe's, on the other hand, has fallen over 4.5% after its report and currently sits more than 7.5% below its 52-week high. I believe Home Depot is the better company for the next 10 years.|The Foolish bottom lineHome Depot and Lowe's both reported great results this week. Home Depot blew past expectations, while Lowe's fell just short, causing the stocks to move in different directions. Both companies have the potential to outperform the overall market for years to come and provide both dividends and share repurchases along the way. Investors should look to buy Home Depot on any significant pullback or weakness provided by the market. Take a look and see if your portfolio could use one of the home improvement kings.|Home Depot and Lowe's aren't the only Kings in the marketAnd while the two leading home improvement retailers are positioned for even bigger and better things in the future, there's a smaller lesser know company that should be on your radar.

Given the success that larger rivals Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA) have had with footwear and athletic apparel recently, Foot Locker's failure to participate in a big share-price rally shows that the company has work ahead to take full advantage of the opportunity in the industry.|Foot Locker is in something of a tough position. On one hand, it actually stocks merchandise made by Nike and Under Armour, meaning that it relies on the success of their products to bring customers into its stores. Yet as those two companies have taken greater steps toward establishing their own independent retail presence, Foot Locker faces the challenge of competing against some of its most important suppliers. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Foot Locker over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Foot Locker's second-quarter results showed solid though somewhat slow growth. Sales rose by 6% on a nearly 12% rise in net income, but earnings failed to match the higher growth expectations investors had for the athletic retailer. Year-to-date comparable-store sales of 3.5% look attractive compared to many retailers in other areas, but they don't produce the growth necessary to keep up with Nike and Under Armour in the long run.|Yet the biggest question facing Foot Locker is the extent to which it can actually cash in on Nike's and Under Armour's success. Foot Locker has done a good job of rolling out various brands from its suppliers, with Nike running-shoe brands like Flyknit and Free starting to pick up steam. How well Foot Locker is able to negotiate with Under Armour and Nike to get favorable terms in its supply contracts will be the key to driving earnings growth going forward. Still, as those suppliers develop new ways to distribute their products, Foot Locker might find itself in the difficult situation of having to accept less attractive terms just to get the goods it needs to bring customers into its stores.

The exception to this rule is in the big-box retailers Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , Target (NYSE: TGT) , and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) , all three of which are very different investments from one another.|Wal-Mart is probably the safest and best income play of the three, while Costco arguably has the most compelling future growth potential, and Target is a very nice combination of the two. Let's examine these three companies, see how they compare as long-term investments, and which may be the best for your investment goals.|Wal-Mart has a historic volatility of 13.1%, compared with 15.9% for Target, and 17.2% for Costco, which is why I said above that Wal-Mart is the most stable. However, none of these are particularly volatile compared with other popular retail stocks. For example, the very popular (but specialized) retailer Coach has historic volatility of 30.2%. Now, let's see how these big-box retailers compare in terms of creating income for shareholders, and which has the best growth potential going forward.|Income and growth potentialWal-Mart pays a good but not great dividend yield of about 2.4%. However, more important to investors is what the yield could grow to in the future. Over the past decade, Wal-Mart has increased its dividend from $0.52 to $1.88, which translates to an average of more than 15% each year!|While Wal-Mart has some potential to grow (overseas, in particular), it is the closest to full maturity of any of the companies here. Wal-Mart is already America's No. 1 grocer, and there is a Wal-Mart store in virtually every town in the U.S. that could financially justify its presence.|So, which is best for you?The company that makes the best fit for your portfolio depends on several factors such as risk tolerance, time frame, and income expectations. As a buy-and-holder with no pressing need for current income, I lean toward Costco in this space, as I think it has the potential to be just as big as Wal-Mart, and the growth currently priced into the shares is very reasonable. If you need income, either of the other two would work, as you'll likely see their dividends rise for years to come.

J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) lost more than half of its market value after the company's rebranding efforts failed to improve sales. Sears and Staples are burning cash, and could soon become mere entries in the archives of Wikipedia. To keep same-store sales growth in the 2% range, some companies are investing their gross margins and lowering prices even further, such as Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) .|The big exception here is Costco (NASDAQ: COST) . This year has been outstanding for the retailer, and with more than $100 billion in annual revenue, Costco keeps growing its top-line and making profits consistently. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company saw 5% growth in U.S. same-store sales and 7% growth in international sales. Moreover, the company even managed to improve profitability by 1.3% despite the effect of negative currency fluctuations. So what is Costco doing different? Is Costco on its way to replace Wal-Mart and become the largest retailer in the world?|The Costco way versus the Wal-Mart wayUnlike Wal-Mart, Costco uses a paid-membership business model. Customers need to become Costco members in order to purchase merchandise at discounted price, paying at least $55 per year for the membership. This allows Costco to collect most of its profits 12 months in advance. Roughly 70% of the company's operating income is generated in this way.|Aware of the benefits of having a strong community of customers, Wal-Mart is expanding its Sam's Club subsidiary, which also uses a membership model. However, Sam's Club may be failing to capture market share from Costco. This is because Costco, apart from offering slightly lower price points on certain key products, is trying to improve its customer experience by implementing kind return policies, accepting several payment methods, and adding gift prizes. More importantly, Costco is always changing its brands and introducing new products in order to provide customers with a pleasant "treasure hunt" experience.|At this point, the main advantage that Wal-Mart has over Costco is its pricing power. With more than $400 billion in annual global sales, Wal-Mart can in theory impose the most favorable terms possible from its suppliers and vendors. However, if Costco continues opening 25-40 global warehouses per year, high-single-digit revenue growth rates should help to minimize the pricing power difference between Costco and Wal-Mart.|Foolish bottom lineCostco is a great pick for one simple reason: the company excels at building a strong, loyal customer community. This allows Costco to enjoy recurrent, recession-proof revenue, and to get most of its operating profit 12 months in advance via annual membership fees. This competitive advantage should protect the company from competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target, which enjoy stronger pricing power.|If some of the 1.2 million Americans working at Wal-Mart -- which is 10x more than Costco -- suddenly didn't -- i.e. if the living wage protests resulted in some of them to lose jobs --- there would be even more of a burden on taxpayers and more would people require assistance. And also Wal-Mart's revenues are > 4x that of Costco and makes a bigger impact on the overall economy.

Today I will be looking at Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and what the company has in store in 2014 and beyond.|On the surface, many blue-chip stocks on the Dow look like fully mature companies that have little room to grow. But with Wal-Mart, that is not the case. Neither here at home nor on the global stage has the company reached its maximum store count. Wal-Mart plans to open between 120 to 150 small-format stores, which usually are about 38,000 square feet, while also opening around 125 large-format stores, which are larger than 100,000 square feet. (The "Supercenters" come in at around 185,000 square feet.) The company plans to have these new stores open before January 2015.|Currently Wal-Mart has 306 small-format locations, so this addition would increase the store count by more than 25%. The additional larger-format stores don't represent a huge increase, considering Wal-Mart already operates more than 11,000 such locations around the world. Nevertheless, this shows that the company has not yet reached its maximum store count in the U.S.|Wal-Mart has some amazing opportunities around the world left to explore. Based on information from the company's Chinese chief, Greg Foran, Wal-Mart will be adding 110 locations in China over the next three years. Additionally, the retailer will close 30 stores during that time due to weak performance. But as we have seen with other companies moving into China, dominant U.S. brands do not always work there.|While the Chinese expansion can be seen as a great growth opportunity for Wal-Mart, we need to view this move with a little caution. If 110 stores are opened in the next few years, we have to imagine a few of them will fail. The company is planning to close 30 of its 398 locations in the country, or 7.5%. It seems growth in China will come with difficulty, so investors shouldn't expect 1,000 locations in China for a long time.|Final thoughtsI often hear investors, analysts, and experts say that although Wal-Mart won't lose massive market share to competitors like Amazon.com and Target, it will grow slowly. However, I can't help but think about the story of the tortoise and the hare. Slow and steady won that race, and while on the surface it may seem Wal-Mart doesn't have a lot of growth left, I believe it will continue adding 100 or more stores to its global store count each year for a very, very long time. With more than 4,000 locations in the U.S. and little more than 6,000 locations throughout the rest of the world, growth can and will continue for the king of retail.

There have been major Boeing headlines over the last week, some good and some bad.|Boeing's 777 during takeoff, the predecessor to the 777X. Photo credit: Boeing.|Let's look at the good news first. Boeing dominated the start of the five-day Dubai Airshow, bringing in more than $100 billion in orders on the first day alone. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner received an order that put it past its 1,000-sale milestone, but it was the 777X's debut that stole the show. Boeing chalked up $95 billion in orders for 259 777X aircraft on the first day of the air show That will be tacked onto Boeing's already enormous $415 billion order backlog.|Now, the bad news. Investors continue to take in the meaning of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers', or IAMAW, rejection of Boeing's contract extension in its Everett, Wash., plant. According to Boeing, workers' concessions to their pension plans would help keep the company competitive and healthy. Union approval of the deal would have secured an estimated 56,000 jobs for another two decades -- a clearly significant decision.|After the union voted against Boeing's offer by a two-thirds majority, Boeing is now considering moving production of its 777X to another location; South Carolina has emerged as a primary option.|For a history lesson, consider that roughly four years ago Boeing threatened to open a second 787 production line in South Carolina unless the same union agreed not to strike for a full decade. Union workers stood their ground, and Boeing wasn't bluffing. It headed to South Carolina. After its recent rejected offer, Boeing will again decide if it was bluffing and will choose the production site for its 777X within three months.|Dividend stocks like Ford and Boeing can make you rich.It's as simple as that.

But the 777X won't be ready until 2020, assuming the new aircraft is on schedule.|"We believe investors are overlooking how a convergence of factors are aligning to make 2015 a medium-term peak," wrote Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner in his report. He said Boeing's investment in the 787 Dreamliner "should top out in 2015, but the call on cash is likely to be quickly replaced by investments in the 737MAX and 777X.|Meanwhile, "2016 looks to bring a material drop-off in contribution from several key cash cow programs, including the 777, C-17, F-18 and V-22," he wrote, noting that Boeing "appears compelling" at 12.8 times 2015 free cash flow, but less so at 14 times 2016 cash flow.|Boeing closed Tuesday at $136.98. In premarket trading Wednesday, shares were down 93 cents. Boeing shares are up 82% this year, leading the Dow. Shares reached an all-time high of $142 in intra-day trading on Monday before starting a pullback.|Recently, everything has been going right for Boeing. At the Dubai Air Show, the company announced 259 orders for the 777X, with a list price of $100 billion, the largest commercial aircraft launch in history. The Dubai success was widely reported on Monday, triggering the share price gain.|But success can have a downside. "The launch of the 777X appears to have left the 777 program, which accounts for an estimated quarter of Boeing's total profit, in the lurch," Reiner wrote. Boeing booked 68 net 777 orders in 2012 but has only 42 so far this year. As a result, the 777 has only a 3.3-year order backlog, but the 777X won't be ready for seven years. That means production could decline to about 65 planes per year by 2018, down from 100 today, Reiner estimated.|Additionally, Boeing's defense business appears to be shrinking. Reiner said investors appear to have ignored the decline, but "that may be increasingly difficult to do going forward.' He said revenue from the C-17, F-18, V-22 and F-15 seems likely to shrink substantially by 2016. Overall, Boeing's free cash flow should peak in 2015 at $8.1 billion and then decline to $7.3 billion in 2016,|Another downside to success: It may have sparked Boeing's hubris. Two weeks ago, the company presented a wish list of a contract offer to 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists, accompanied by the threat that Boeing would move 777X work out of the Seattle area if workers voted against the offer. Nevertheless, two-thirds of workers voted to reject the contrcat. Boeing said it is reviewing possible alternate sites.

While momentum traders might be attracted to the stock's steady climb in 2013, Reiner believes that Mr. Market might be underestimating some headwinds working against the company.|Now what: Oppenheimer sees Boeing's risk and reward trade-off as pretty balanced at this point. "While we still see Boeing's FCF improving over the next two years, we believe investors are overlooking how a convergence of factors are aligning to make 2015 a medium-term peak," noted Oppenheimer. "Yes, 787 investment should (should) top out in 2015, but the call on cash is likely to be quickly replaced by investments in the 737MAX and 777x." With Boeing shares still up about 90% from their 52-week lows, and trading at a 20-plus P/E, waiting for a wider margin of safety certainly seems prudent.

As of 2:30 p.m. EST, the Dow's lost about 27 points in what's been a lackluster day for the blue-chip index. Stocks are pretty evenly split on the Dow, but two big movers stand out. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) gained more than 1% to rank among the Dow's leaders, while Boeing's (NYSE: BA) plunged by more than 2% to fall to the bottom of the index. Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Boeing's potential keeps risingBoeing's stock is diving despite a good turn at the recent Dubai Air Show, where Boeing and rival Airbus racked up a combined $179 billion in orders, according to Bloomberg. It's a huge total for these two aerospace leaders, and Boeing crossed the 1,000-order mark in total for its new 787 Dreamliner airplane. It's a significant milestone for a craft that was beset by problems to start the year, and it's a testament to Boeing's resilience that the 787 looks to be soaring into a bright future.|So why are investors down on the stock today? Shares have boomed more than 77% so far this year, an impressive rise for such a sturdy and giant company like Boeing. It's no surprise that investors would want to reap rewards from their investments after such a gain, but Boeing might not be done rising as it pushes into next year.|Despite U.S. defense budget cuts that have threatened the growth of its military aircraft sales -- both revenue and operating margin are down for the segment -- Boeing's civilian aircraft business has exploded in 2013 with the Dreamliner's arrival. The division makes up 60% of Boeing's total sales, so as long as civil aircraft orders continue to perform well -- even if not up to the boom seen in Dubai -- Boeing will continue to fly high.|Microsoft, on the other hand, isn't letting any investors down today with its rise. This stock hasn't performed like Boeing this year, but Microsoft's shares still have gained more than 33% year to date. Investors today are warming up to the end-of-the-week launch of the company's new Xbox One entertainment and gaming console, which is looking to rise as high as rival Sony's (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 4 console has during its debut.|The easiest way for your to reach your financial potentialMicrosoft and Boeing are thinking for the long-term, but are you doing the same with your portfolio? It's no secret that investors tend to be impatient with the market, but the best investment strategy is to buy shares in solid businesses and keep them for the long term.

However, although the company's top-line results and weak guidance were disappointing, Cisco's operating profit came in above the forecast, and operating cash flow remains solid.|Source: Cisco Investor Relations|Adapting to a changing industryOverall, Cisco remains well-positioned in key markets, such as data networking, switching, and routing solutions. The company's network certification remains the industry standard. More importantly, management keeps focused on new markets, like the Internet of everything.|Although Cisco has a well-diversified product portfolio, its most important revenue source is clearly the switches and routers business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the company's product revenue. This is because Cisco's proprietary hardware is the backbone of hundreds of corporate networks.|The SDN threatSince they are hardware-independent, SDN solutions are a real threat to Cisco's dominant position in the network industry. Juniper Networks is particularly hard to beat, because the company is using a licensing business model that prioritizes software over hardware. Apart from being cheaper, Juniper's SDN solutions make networks more programmable and personalized. As a result, the company has grown its revenue for five consecutive years, reporting $1.19 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2013.|Security solutions is a promising marketThe good news is that although SDN solutions are a real threat to Cisco's ability to cross-sell its hardware, an innovative culture and a constant search of new business opportunities could help to offset any adverse effect on revenue. In particular, increasing demand for security is an attractive growth catalyst, as the global market for network security is expected to reach $13.4 billion by 2016.|Cisco's security business unit currently accounts for only 3% of total revenues. However, the company has been investing heavily in this segment. For example, it bought cyber security firm Sourcefire this year, which specializes in network security and advanced malware protection.|The Internet of everythingCisco's main growth catalyst is the Internet of everything, which is set to increase the global demand for networks, routers and sensors. The company is an early mover, as it is investing in developing low-cost, low-power sensors, that can be programmed to share information over the Internet.|Foolish bottom lineAlthough Cisco experienced a tough quarter, it remains well-positioned in key markets, such as routing. Surely, the company faces strong competitors in every segment, from security to switching. However, cash flow remains solid and management is committed to finding new markets, such as security and the Internet of everything. Last week's market sell-off could actually be a great buying opportunity for patient investors.

In the past four years, Tile Shop delivered the highest EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, margin in the industry, much higher than Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) . According to the company's November presentation, its EBITDA margin was 26% for the past twelve months. With trailing EBITDA of more than $5.54 billion, Lowe's EBITDA margin was much lower at only 10.70%. Home Depot's EBITDA margin was in-between these at around 13.20%.|Indeed, there are several red flags regarding the cash generating ability of Tile Shop. In the past four quarters, Tile Shop reported negative free cash flow of -$31 million, while the free cash flows of Home Depot and Lowe's were $6 billion and $3.36 billion, respectively. Moreover, Tile Shop's inventory grew at a much faster rate than its sales. In the third quarter, while Tile Shop's revenue increased by 28.2%, inventory rose by 53.3%.|Looking deeper, the main growth in inventory was the rise in finished goods, from $39.4 million in December 2012 to $59.5 million in September 2013. The higher level of finished goods indicates a slowdown in sales and weakened cash generating ability. Better scenarios occurred at Home Depot and Lowe's.

At $48.00, the P/E is now 19 and their price to sales is .76. As the US Economy continues to recover in 2014 and Home Building/Renovations continue to grow, Lowes will likely do well. I would have to imagine that after their slight miss last night that their senior management will be scrambling to close the gap with Home Depot.

Say hello to pharmaceuticals veteran Merck (NYSE: MRK) and its current 3.6% dividend yield.|That figure places Merck just below the Dow's two telecoms in terms of dividend generosity, virtually tied for third place with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) . It's certainly a strong payout, but that doesn't make Merck a no-brainer choice for income investors. Merck's dividend policy comes with some serious flaws.|This chart will show you the two most serious red flags that hover over Merck's dividend policies:|Infraction No. 1: Merck isn't really into growing its dividends. The size of its quarterly checks flatlined for nearly a decade, and they have only increased by 13% in the last couple years.|Infraction No. 2: Merck really can't afford to raise its dividend payouts. The company already spends more on these distributions than it collects in net earnings. It's the third highest such ratio on the Dow -- behind AT&T and Verizon -- and this is a case of small numbers beating big ones.|The picture changes if you move from non-generally accepted accounting principles earnings to consider the dividends as a fraction of Merck's free cash flow. But it's not a drastic difference: Merck spends 61% of its free cash flow on dividend payments, which is still in the top quarter of all Dow components.|By comparison, Intel's cash-based payout ratio is just 43%, leaving lots additional room for future dividend increases. Not to rub salt in Merck's wounds (the company would prefer a generous layer of Coppertone), but Intel has absolutely crushed Merck's timid dividend increases over the last decade.|There may be many good reasons to invest in Merck, but the dividend policy isn't one of them. Look away from the tempting dividend yield to consider these two red flags and Merck's stock starts to look like a poor choice for serious income investors.|Can you find better dividend plays on the Dow?Merck may not be an inspiring dividend play, but the Dow is stacked to the rafters with better choices. Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine. With this in mind, our analysts sat down to identify the absolute best of the best when it comes to rock-solid dividend stocks, drawing up a list in this free report of nine that fit the bill.

The new store, part of a larger revamp coming to all Verizon retail locations, is an attempt to build brand loyalty among users.|Verizon's move is an example of a larger trend of tech and wireless companies seeking to duplicate Apple's retail success -- and an attempt to set itself apart from the wireless pack.|More than just storesVerizon's destination store opened in the Mall of America in Minnesota and offers customers five distinct "zones" for fitness, music, gaming, and business, as well as home and energy. The goal of the stores is to educate consumers about mobile devices and services, and to offer workshops, tech support, and demonstrations.|Verizon is following in the footsteps of Microsoft and Samsung in trying to recreate Apple's retail success. Recently, even Intel announced it would open stores geared to community events. Part of Verizon's ambition is to grow sales at its retail locations and enhance its brand, and it's not a bad strategy.|One thing Verizon could accomplish with its stores is to raise customer smartphone satisfaction rates. Though the company has received generally positive customer service ratings lately, a J.D. Power report last month showed Verizon placed at the bottom of the wireless carrier list for overall satisfaction with smartphone devices. A physical location where customers can ask questions and play with devices could certainly help with this issue. In the past, wireless stores were places you picked up a device that wasn't even turned on and tried to decide if you wanted to buy it. That was a bad way to make customers happy. The new Verizon stores will be places where users can interact with devices before making a purchase.|U.S. wireless carriers are beginning to offer similar network speeds and coverage, as well as selling many of the same mobile devices. This makes it all the more important for these companies to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier by customers, and the new stores may be an attempt at increasing loyalty and device satisfaction. With carriers fighting vigorously for customer attention, the destination stores are just another step for Verizon in keeping its No. 1 spot.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/20/t-mobile-subscribers-dont-like-apples-iphone.aspx|11/20/2013|0|"Verizon Communications"|33|But there's something interesting about T-Mobile's new subscribers -- they don't seem to care for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Not that they don't want it -- T-Mobile sold about 900,000 iPhones last quarter -- but that, proportionately, they aren't buying as many of them. Last quarter, just 21% of the smartphones T-Mobile sold were iPhones; in comparison, a whopping 51% of Verizon's smartphone activations were Apple-made handsets.|In contrast, subscribers on other carriers are likely to be far less sensitive to the cost of their phones -- the monthly bill is largely the same no matter which handset they use. Verizon Wireless offers cheaper phones, but there is little reason to purchase one. The Pantech Marauder, a phone running Google's Android, costs $340 unlocked. Subscribers signing a two-year agreement with Verizon get it for free, but customers would do themselves a great disservice in purchasing it.|Getting an iPhone 5s costs just $200 more because Verizon subsidizes the phone so generously. But compared to Pantech's phone, Apple's handset is well worth the extra $200, especially because contract signers will be forced to use it for two years. CNet gave Pantech's phone a rating of 7.0 (out of 10) lamenting its laggy processor; in contrast, it gave the iPhone 5s an 8.8, calling it the "fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date."|But once you get your new phone, you'll pay the same for monthly service -- for a plan with 2GB of data, Verizon charges about $100 per month. Users of Apple's iPhone 5s or Pantech's Marauder will end up paying the same monthly fee.|The difference between the U.S. smartphone market and other countries largely comes down to subsidies -- Apple depends on carriers footing the majority of the bill for its expensive phones. That works exceptionally well when the carrier is Verizon, where flat monthly bills incentivize subscribers to get the best-quality phones possible, regardless of the price.|T-Mobile has only offered the iPhone for 6 months, where Verizon and ATT have offered the iPhone for years. They have zero repeat iPhone customers and ever customer is making a first time iPhone purchase from T-Mobile.|Verizon (and I think AT&T) have moved the subsidy eligibility from 20 months (to lock you in before you can leave) to 24 months (meaning you are free of contract). This has caused me to, for the first time in years, consider switching of Verizon. The iPhone that I wanted didn't even cause me to switch to AT&T. That is how "loyal" to Verizon I was. But their less customer friendly approaches over the past couple years, along with every carrier offering unlimited talk and text, really makes the only difference in carriers network quality and price. Network, first, as AT&T and Verizon are comparable price wise.|The point of the article that subsidies cause people to be less price conscious is well taken, but I take issue with the description of Verizon's subsidies as "generous". If you buy a 16GB iPhone 5s ($649 unlocked) from Verizon with a two-year contract, you will pay $199 up front and have to sign up for a required data plan at a minimum of $30/month. Over the course of the contract, you will therefore pay $919 for your $649 iPhone. I'd say its Verizon's customers who are being generous.|All carriers rush to add the iPhone to their portfolios as soon as they can to help insure that they can finance their expensive network infrastructure conversions to 4-G. Verizon, T Mobile, and Domoco in Japan were losing customers until they carried the iPhone. Similar experience with China Mobile to the next two smaller carriers.|HUH? The article totally missed the point - it's the plan TOTAL cost. Others have correctly noted the lack of history with iPhone, and the embedded costs adds up on ATT and Verizon where after 2 years it mathematically makes sense to get a new phone because you are paying that approx. $20/mo anyway as it stays hidden in the bill. That is precisely why I left ATT in Oct when my 2 years was up for T-Mobile. Now, looking at cost (2 phone family plan) taxes included, ATT $156/mo and similar coverage T-Mobile and includes the monthly payment for the 2 phones, $144/mo. Technically, ATT was even higher as insurance was paid separately to a 3rd party, but rolled into the T-Mobile bill.|Now let's look at the phones. What's with comparing the iPhone to the low end Nokia? How about the true competition that people decide between - Samsung S4 (or cheaper S3), HTC One, or LG G2 which is what I got for $0 down while ATT wanted $199 for the same phone. Monthly charges for androids was around $25/mo while both Apples were $21/mo. At ATT, the initial down payment for each phone was similar, with the exception of the LG with the monthly charge hidden in their monthly charge rather than itemized and terminating when paid for at T-Mobile. ATT's semi-competitive NEXT option was even more expensive while appearing less expensive, and had a completive monthly cost for the phone. In fact, if you do the math with both ATT and T-Mobile (and Verizon) the total cost over 2 years equals the outright purchase of an unlocked phone.|Why did I choose the LG? I came in for the Apple 5s ($199 T-Mobile and everywhere) but no inventory and waiting list and wife's phone requiring replacement now. Was going to compromise with the 5C ($49 T-Mobile and everywhere) and use the JUMP program in 6 month (a year with ATT or Verizon competitive programs). Settled on the LG G2 ($0 at T-Mobile while $199 at ATT and $149 Verizon) as I didn't want the upfront investment that would never be returned if I was going to JUMP in 6 months.

For others, though, the situation was quite the opposite. Namely, Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) both failed to impress Mr. Market as they fell short of expectations. On top of this, another retailer, Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD) , reports this week with a lot at stake.|Wal-Mart experienced lackluster resultsFor Wal-Mart, last week was less than ideal, but it was still better than it was for Kohl's. During its most recent fiscal quarter, the $257 billion retailer reported revenue that fell short of Mr. Market's expectations but that exceeded analyst expectations.|Foolish takeawayClearly, the situation of both Kohl's and Wal-Mart can be looked back on with the benefit of foresight being 20/20. Using the data presented by management during each company's earnings release, investors should have a better understanding of the risks and rewards that each of these companies offers. Sears, on the other hand, is another story entirely. Though investors can benefit from the information put out by analysts, it won't be until the company reports earnings on Thursday that market participants will have a better understanding of what the future holds. Although there are signs that a turnaround is possible, I plan on playing it safe and sitting by the sidelines.

That could spell more trouble for GameStop's sales.|GameStop faces new game competition from big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart that have the leverage to offer better discounts to customers. Wal-Mart also offers the advantage of picking up a new game while doing general shopping. But used games have become GameStop's primary segment, and Wal-Mart doesn't sell pre-owned games -- but Amazon does.

However, Best Buy differs from these companies in that it earns the majority of its annual profit during the holiday season. Additionally, consumer electronics is Best Buy's main business, but a small part of the mix at Wal-Mart and Target, and is often used as a loss leader for those companies.|Best Buy's drive to "win" the holiday season could end in a Pyrrhic victory. An all-out consumer electronics price war will hurt Best Buy a lot more than it will hurt Wal-Mart or Target. Best Buy may be able to improve upon its recent sales trends, but only by taking a big hit to the bottom line.|Desperate for businessWal-Mart has become increasingly desperate to drive store traffic recently, as comparable-store sales have declined every quarter this year. Its "Black Friday" doorbusters (which will actually be available beginning at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving) include a $98 LCD TV, and a $100 gift card with the purchase of a first-generation iPad mini.|Most important, Wal-Mart is providing a "1-Hour In-Stock Guarantee" on these doorbusters: If you are in the store by 7 p.m. and request one, Wal-Mart is guaranteeing that you will get that item. If the store runs out of stock on that day, customers will be able to buy a guarantee card that reserves the item for pickup before Christmas. This stands in stark contrast to typical Black Friday limited-quantity doorbusters.|Despite carrying low margins for retailers, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products are seeing heavy promotion this year. Aside from Wal-Mart's iPad mini offer, Wal-Mart and Target are providing gift cards with iPhone purchases. Target is also offering $20 off the iPad Air and a $100 gift card.|So far, Best Buy's Black Friday deals don't seem quite as impressive as anything Wal-Mart and Target have rolled out -- although Best Buy is offering $100 off the older iPad 2 and some pretty good TV deals. However, Best Buy is holding back some "mystery" deals until Thanksgiving Day, presumably to avoid being preempted by competitors.|Based on comments made by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly on the company's conference call yesterday, these "mystery" deals could be very competitive. Best Buy is committed to being a low-price leader during the holiday season. Given the lengths to which Wal-Mart and Target seem willing to go to drive customer traffic, this could put significant pressure on Best Buy's gross margin.|Wal-Mart executives have stated bluntly that they are using consumer electronics products as Black Friday loss leaders that will drive traffic into the stores. The company can then -- hopefully -- make up for those losses through higher sales in other categories. Target's strategy is similar. However, Best Buy doesn't have the same general merchandise offerings as either one of those competitors.|Additionally, analysts estimate that Best Buy will earn more than two-thirds of its annual profit during the fourth quarter. By contrast, while that period is also the most profitable quarter for Wal-Mart and Target, it represents well under half of the annual profit for both companies.|Two top retail picks from The Motley FoolThe retail market is rapidly changing and only a few companies are keeping up.

This stands in contrast with retailers Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) , which posted disappointing results in their latest quarters. Macy's appears to be firing on all cylinders, and it's shaping up to be a strong holiday season for the company's shareholders. It looks like Santa Claus is coming to Macy's, while the Grinch is going to Wal-Mart and Kohl's.|Still no improvementWal-Mart just posted a same-store sales decline of 0.3% for the third quarter. This was the third straight quarter of sales declines for the largest retailer in the U.S. Wal-Mart also cut its annual profit forecast for the second time since August.|Wal-Mart is facing a number of issues that Macy's isn't. A good portion of Wal-Mart's customers have lower incomes, and this segment of the population is still seeing high unemployment rates. Wal-Mart also gets a large part of its business from seniors who have seen a 2% increase in Social Security taxes take a bite out of their wallets. Overall, a large portion of Wal-Mart's customers live paycheck to paycheck. When they have less spending power, they take their business to dollar stores and look for the cheapest prices.|To try and turn things around, Wal-Mart is gearing up for the holiday shopping season with a focus on Black Friday. On Black Friday, Wal-Mart will increase the number of one-hour guaranteed items and offer "Manager Specials." The retailer wants to offer more deals on the season's top gifts.|Kohl's, like Wal-Mart, is hoping for a strong holiday season and is gearing up for Black Friday. Kohl's plans to open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, which is earlier than ever before. The company plans to offer more than 500 Black Friday deals at its stores and online. Kohl's will also offer $15 Kohl's Cash for every $50 spent online or in its stores.|Foolish assessmentLast month, I was a big fan of Kohl's in "The Best Retailer for Your Portfolio." Well, now it looks like that title belongs to Macy's. Wal-Mart still hasn't been able to turn things around and Kohl's is no longer posting strong sales gains, but instead is heading backwards.

In 2011 it started operating in Africa. The company will also open more than 240 new "Neighborhood Market" grocery stores to complement its regular stores and super centers.

Comparable sales for its second quarter were softer than expected, increasing just 1.2% in the period. But analysts are looking for sales growth of 2.6% in Q3. If Target posts declining same-store sales tomorrow, the stock could take a hit. Just look at what happened to shares of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) last week.|Wal-Mart's sales at stores that have been open at least a year declined 0.3% in its third quarter. In fact, "300 or so Wal-Mart U.S. stores were producing negative same-store sales of around 7%," according to Brian Sozzi of Belus Capital Advisors. As Wal-Mart's biggest rival in the big-box segment, this could spell trouble for Target. Investors will want to know whether Target has been able to pull more shoppers through its doors with initiatives, including exclusive product launches and limited-edition collections from top fashion designers.|Hitting Wall Street's targetLooking to Target's earnings reveal tomorrow, analysts are expecting earnings per share of $0.63 on revenue of $17.36 billion in the quarter. Shares of Target are up more than 15% year to date. But soft holiday sales could still put a dent in the stock going forward. Target is preparing for the holiday rush by opening its doors at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year.

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is offering a 32" flat-screen TV on Black Friday for only $98, one-third less than its cut-rate deal last year. Just about every retailer is eschewing the traditional start to the holiday shopping season and opening up on Thanksgiving Day itself, while Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD) is so worried that its Kmart stores will open up at 6 a.m. that day and stay open for 41 hours straight.|Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict this will be the worst holiday shopping season since the depths of the recession in 2008. Burdened by $148 billion in new payroll taxes that started in 2013, consumers face a looming health care tax next year if they don't have coverage by March 31 (not to mention the other Obamacare taxes that kick in on Jan. 1). And at the start of this month, 47 million food stamp recipients saw their benefits cut, a move that will only serve to worsen the results at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and Target (NYSE: TGT) , which see around half of those benefits spent in their stores.|Although Wal-Mart tries to spin the cuts as beneficial -- when stretching the dollar becomes paramount, the discount retailer becomes "more relevant" -- there's more than one reason it was forced to cut its full-year earnings forecast again.|The NRF's Shop.org says that over the months of November and December it expects online sales to surge 13%-15% from last year, hitting as much as $82 billion. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the most visited site on Black Friday in 2012 (followed, in order, by Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, and Apple), and there's no reason to think it won't be the beneficiary again this year. But even if some retailers make up in e-commerce what they lose at their brick-and-mortar stores, there's going to be little holiday cheer for the majority of them.

According to the company, revenue came up short primarily due to currency fluctuations. Without these fluctuations, it would have had sales of $116.2 billion.|Upon analyzing Wal-Mart's earnings release, I concluded that the rise in earnings was primarily attributable to two factors: margin improvement and fewer common shares outstanding. Margins weren't significantly different in any given area, but minor improvements, like cost of goods falling from 75.1% of sales to 74.9% of sales, were largely responsible.

Even though the plane isn't expected to be ready until 2020, Boeing has already racked up 259 orders worth more than $95 billion at list prices. Most notably, Emirates -- which is now the world's biggest international airline -- placed a record-setting order for 150 of the new jets!|The 777X is Boeing's new weapon for disrupting the jumbo-jet market (Photo: Boeing)|The 777X will allow Boeing to maintain its dominance in the widebody aircraft market for the foreseeable future. Between the 787 family and the new 777X family, Boeing now offers highly efficient long-range widebody aircraft that can meet almost any size requirements. Moreover, I don't think Airbus has any good response available.|For a long time, the market for widebodies capable of long-haul flights was divided between smaller twin-engine jets and large three-to-four-engine planes like the Boeing 747 and MD-11. However, as engines have become more powerful and more reliable, twin-engine designs have taken over more and more of the market.|The original Boeing 777, which entered service almost two decades ago, began that process, as it was close in size to early 747 variants. The 747 has grown in size in order to avoid competing with the 777, while Airbus has more recently introduced the massive A380 "super-jumbo."|However, the super-jumbo segment is a niche market, as most airlines do not fly many routes that can support airplanes of that size. Indeed, while the Airbus A380 entered service six years ago, through the end of October Airbus had just 259 total firm orders . That's the exact same number of orders that Boeing announced for the 777X this weekend alone! (Airbus did receive another 50 A380 orders from Emirates this week, so it is still ahead for now .)|With the 777X, improvements in engine technology and wing design are boosting fuel efficiency even further. At the same time, the larger model (the 777-9X) is significantly bigger than the 777-300 (Boeing's largest twin-engine plane today), or the A350-1000 that Airbus is currently developing. As a result, the 777-9X will have the lowest unit cost of any commercial airplane .|Airbus has done an admirable job growing in the narrowbody market; its A320 aircraft family has overtaken the Boeing 737 in terms of future orders. However, it has been unable to catch Boeing in the widebody market. Despite a variety of reliability issues, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner just passed the 1,000 order mark , whereas the competing Airbus A350 only had 764 orders as of Oct. 31 .|The launch of the 777X will complete Boeing's domination of the widebody market. Boeing has effectively "covered" the A350's market and then some with its new widebody lineup. At the bottom of the A350 family, Boeing's 787-9 competes directly with the A350-800. The recently introduced 787-10 competes directly with the A350-900. Meanwhile, the new 777-8X competes directly with the larger A350-1000 model .|Boeing also launched the 787-10 this year, filling another market segment (Photo: Boeing)|However, Boeing also has the 787-8 (which is smaller than any A350) and the 777-9X (which is larger than any A350). The result is that while Airbus was able to save money by developing a single twin-engine widebody to serve a large swath of the market, Boeing can offer its customers a greater range of sizes. With unique planes at the bottom and top of the twin-engine widebody spectrum, Boeing can meet the needs of any airline, in a way that Airbus cannot.|As a result, Airbus is likely to stand pat and try to compete on price with the A350 and A380. For the moment, the A380 also has the advantage of availability -- today, airlines are looking at nearly 10-year lead times for the 777X. However, in the long run, the superior economics of the new 777X can virtually guarantee Boeing a big lead over Airbus in the widebody market.|Good article. Airbus bet on the A380 being the dominant player in the widebody arena. That's not how the market is shaping up. Boeing is effectively killing its own 747 with the largest of the 777X model. That plane will still work great for cargo but the 777 has superior passenger economics.|As reward to the Boeing Corporations efforts and it's engineering designer staff to design such a fine aircraft, the unions use there time to be ready for there ritual strike games. Make no mistake Airbus will come out with a similar aircraft and in there sales clauses there will be no such mention as to in case of labor strikes the delivery time might be different a clause that is used almost exclusively by US Manufacturers only. We used to sell lathes and milling machines all over the world but these days are gone as other country's build quality products that are delivered on time.|Europe is much more unionized than the U.S., although I don't know the specific circumstances at Airbus. In any case, either the union will agree on a long-term contract with Boeing, or the 777X work will go to a non-union plant. I don't see much of a risk of disruption either way.|With Boeing they need to get the "x" in the air and on time. No mistakes and, if possible, early. If they can this plane will be the key to taking a large chunk of the market. It will also help move past the mistakes of moving from Aluminum to carbon fiber (a needed change).|Boeing needs to sort out where to build them, either with union labor on the left coast or in a right to work state. I'm not sure why the union wouldn't be trying to hammer out a deal that would benefit them with a decades of work.|Airbus understands the need to compete in all payload-range segments just as much as Boeing. In an A350-2000 (if so named), they'd have newer technology than Boeing, too (a composite fuselage as well as the wing).|And, as you so rightly say, they'll be trying to snuff Boeing sales by undercutting on price across all segments of the market. It's time the Boeing unions really got the message that this is a war of attrition as much as a race to line their own pockets. Winning the war will conserve their jobs.|@DNMay: Actually, the A350 is the same width as the 777X to within an inch. Boeing doesn't seem to think it would be very easy for Airbus to stretch the A350. I'm inclined to agree -- although I am not an engineer! But in addition to the wings and engines, you need more structural support for a bigger aircraft. I don't think that the A350 was designed with the capability to be stretched beyond the -1000.|Leaving that aside, even if Airbus needs relatively minor changes beyond the new wing and new engines, it's still almost as big an R&D project as what Boeing is undertaking, but only attacking 1 of the 2 777X market segments. So it's a less efficient investment from that perspective.|The 777X design bit-the-bullet in stretching the wing span to beyond what gates can handle without folding the tip. This allows Boeing to gain induced drag reduction from a high (i.e., slender) aspect ratio, and enabling more lift (and thus higher aircraft weight) from increased wing area. (The A380 suffers from a low aspect ratio due to accepting gate constraints).|The challenges that Airbus designers will face in further-stretching the A350 (and which Boeing alludes to) are as follows. Will the fuselage get so long that rotation on takeoff is impossible without lengthening the gear? Will a gear extension be necessary anyway to provide ground clearance for larger-diameter engines? Will a wingtip extension provide sufficient extra lift that a wing root plug can be avoided? The above issues, when combined, possibly necessitate a new fuselage center section to accommodate a longer main gear, a beefy midline landing gear, and to provide and support a larger-area, longer-span wing.|These have all been done before. Boeing probably just stepped up to them with the 777X, chasing a probably thousand-airplane market. I doubt that Airbus can neglect this market. They may have to wait until they've digested current new-design commitments to have the human and dollar resources.|In this case, what's probably really disruptive in the market is Airbus offering stretch A350's in Dubai at prices that forced Boeing to even-more-drastically lower prices on the 777X to launch it. Moreover, for the privilege of selling a lot of planes at cut prices, Boeing only gained one 777X customer beyond the Middle East. They have to hope they'll pick up another European, and a major American, customer soon - before Airbus gets its own weighty orders.|The 747-8 market was already dead, so it's not really a loss in my opinion. Boeing will try to sell a few 747s here and there as cargo planes, but I don't think the company has any illusion that it will sell a significant number of 747-8I planes.|@rkrasnod: I would argue that Boeing does dominate the widebody market. Through October it's delivered 166 widebodies in 2013 vs 104 for Airbus. The gap will narrow somewhat when the A350 goes into production, but it won't close entirely. There are more 777 orders than A330 orders, more 787 orders than A350 orders, and there's also a few 767 orders hanging around. (That doesn't even count the 777X orders Boeing just received.) The jumbo jet market, which is quite small comparatively, is the only area where Airbus has a lead.

At the Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced 259 orders, with a list price of $100 billion, the largest commercial aircraft launch in history for the Boeing 777X. The aircraft is a technical marvel that at the moment does not have a competitor.|And how is Boeing reacting to its unprecedented success? Unfortunately not with humility or wisdom or with any apparent awareness that success sometimes goes to a company's head.|Rather, Boeing has reacted with hubris, leading to a dramatically concessionary contract offer to 31,000 members of the International Association of Machinists. The offer was buttressed by a threat to move work on the new aircraft out of Washington, Boeing's principal work site since 1916.|Perhaps Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter and a widely admired corporate leader, is reading the country's mood correctly. Perhaps the union movement truly has been left behind, along with any sense of loyalty or sense of place.|Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001 and opened a 787 assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., in 2011. Neither move caused any apparent harm. Rather, success in South Carolina has only encouraged Boeing to consider locating 777X production outside of Seattle.|This is not to say that companies should not prepare for the future. No doubt Boeing executives look at the U.S. auto industry and see companies that failed to prepare for a future that included rising fuel prices and more consumer choice. That failure led the Detroit Three's market share to decline from 80% in 1985 to about 46% today. For several decades, too-generous labor contracts contributed to a U.S. auto industry model that resulted in too many vehicles produced at too high a cost and then sold at too many dealers.|But Boeing, in its effort to prepare for future challenges from newly emerging competitors, appears to have overreached. Its contract offer this month was every company's wish list: the end of a defined benefit pension plan, increased employee health care payments and limited pay increases for years into the future. The offer was rejected by 67% of voters.|It is worth mentioning that Boeing's move to redesign its production model for the 787 led to billions in cost overruns and a three-year delay in the first delivery. Perhaps that is forgotten now, but it ought to be a warning that decisions involving radical change can have radical consequences.|The auto industry, as well as the airline industry, used bankruptcies to force more austere working conditions on their unions. Boeing took the opposite tack, saying it is so wildly successful that it can do whatever it wants to do.|The question now, in Boeing's case, is whether pride once again will go before a fall.

What about small vehicles?The stations will largely be co-located at Pilot/Flying J truck stops, and heavily feature LNG (liquefied natural gas), which isn't as practical for a car or pickup as compressed natural gas (CNG.) However, neither Clean Energy Fuels, or partner and competitor General Electric (NYSE: GE) , are ignoring the market for autos -- especially when one considers that the domestic gasoline market is in excess of 130 billion gallons, which absolutely dwarfs the diesel market. Many of Clean Energy's LNG stations will be able to provide both CNG and LNG, while GE's "CNG in a Box" system -- which competes with Clean Energy's offerings to some extent -- is a simple solution that will allow fleet operators to more easily incorporate compressed natural gas vehicles into their fleets, and municipal natural gas providers to offer retail natural gas to consumers.|In comes the automakersFord (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) are both working with Westport Innovations to develop bi-fuel engine systems, primarily focused on heavy-duty pickup trucks for now. The reasoning for targeting trucks first is an extension of why Clean Energy has targeted "return to base" first: addressable market. With the refueling infrastructure just beginning to be rolled out, a system that can burn both gasoline and CNG eliminates "range anxiety," and pickups have space for multiple fuel tanks. Add in that that fleets which operate the larger vehicles that work well on CNG usually also have a fleet of trucks for support purposes, and bi-fuel pickups tend to make great sense for the first wave of adoption.|Jason Hall owns shares of Westport Innovations and Clean Energy Fuels.

Quantitative easing has helped the U.S. in a big way, while stimulus has sent Japanese stocks surging to among the world's best this year and driven the once-stagnant Japanese economy into high gear. Considering how lackluster many of Europe's leading economies, such as Italy and France, have been lately, QE could be exactly what the continent's leaders and investors need.|The big news, however, came from Home Depot. The stock rose 1% to the head of the Dow today after the retailer reported that earnings per share jumped more than 50% year over year to $0.95 per share for the most recent quarter.

Overall, it was an absolute blowout quarter and the stock has reacted accordingly.|Competitor due outLowe's (NYSE: LOW) is Home Depot's largest competitor, with 1,758 home improvement stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is set to report earnings on Nov. 20, before the market opens. Last time it reported, on Aug. 21, Lowe's had a very impressive quarter in which earnings rose 37.5%, net sales rose 10.3%, and margins expanded.

The results allowed management to raise its full-year guidance and management now predicts 24% growth from 2012. Home Depot is one of the greatest public companies in the market today; it can offer price appreciation, a healthy dividend, and a management team that is active in initiating share repurchases.

In its most recent quarterly report, Johnson & Johnson reported earnings per share of $1.36 to beat consensus estimates of $1.32 per share.

With the shares having gotten hit hard in recent months, Target needs to come up with ways to outpace Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and emphasize the distinctive ways in which it tries to stand out from the big-box retail crowd.|Target has done a good job of trying to be all things to all shoppers. On one hand, it seeks to compete on price with Wal-Mart and Costco, keeping customers coming in to take advantage of good deals on basic everyday items. Yet to a greater extent than Wal-Mart and Costco, Target has also been about more than just low prices, with the retailer bringing in well-known fashion designers to create special merchandise lines to bring fashion-conscious shoppers into the doors. With that two-part strategy, Target hopes to keep Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and other online competition at bay while giving Wal-Mart and Costco shoppers reasons to switch. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Target over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Target started out the quarter with some disappointing results from its July quarter. Although the company topped earnings estimates by a penny, it reported only mediocre same-store sales growth of 1.2%, and Target said it would likely hit the low end of its previous full-year earnings guidance. CEO Gregg Steinhafel cited "ongoing household budget pressures" as driving the poor results. The only saving grace is that Wal-Mart had similarly bad results, but that didn't stop Target shares from falling on the news, especially given the success Costco has had in avoiding the hits its rivals have taken.|Part of the issue facing Target is an aggressive strategy involving a large expansion into the Canadian market. During the July quarter, Target opened 44 stores in Canada, and it expects to open 56 more by the end of the year. But the expansion is also raising Target's expenses, which is responsible in large part for the falling earnings guidance. If Canada treats Target well, then the short-term pain could bring it a huge competitive advantage against Wal-Mart and Costco by broadening its horizons beyond the domestic retail market.|Still, Target has one thing going for it: its employee base. Target has avoided the labor strife that Wal-Mart faces even though Target pays lower average wages than either Wal-Mart or Costco. With positive ratings for work-life balance and company culture, Target has struck the right balance between keeping costs down and keeping workers happy.

At one point, its position as a low-price leader could drive traffic from value-seeking customers in bad times. However, today its market share is already so high that this effect is swamped by spending cutbacks among its core customers.|That's why I haven't been surprised whatsoever by Wal-Mart's inability to generate sales growth in the U.S. this year. Time and again, its executives have explained away weak results, while promising better times ahead. However, this unfortunate trend shows no signs of stopping.|Weak startWal-Mart's year got off to a rocky start as the U.S. payroll tax reset to its pre-stimulus level. This change lopped 2% off every worker's take-home pay (for the first $113,700 of income). The payroll tax increase had a big impact on Wal-Mart's core customers. A delay in processing income tax refunds added to consumers' troubles.|The result was very slow sales in the first few weeks of February. One Wal-Mart executive described the sales trend as "a total disaster" in an email that was leaked to Bloomberg. While trends improved later in the quarter, Walmart U.S. still experienced a 1.4% comparable-store sales decline in the first quarter.|And a weak finishManagement tried to put a good spin on things after the poor first-quarter result. The company's earnings release highlighted a projection that U.S. comparable-store sales would turn positive again in Q2. This hope proved to be unfounded, as Walmart U.S. comp sales fell 0.3% in the second quarter. This development forced Wal-Mart to cut its full-year EPS guidance. However, it pointed out that at least the decline was much smaller than in Q1.|Last week, Wal-Mart reported third-quarter earnings, and, sure enough, comp sales declined yet again for the Wal-Mart U.S. division.

Year to date, comparable-store sales are down 0.7% at Wa-Mart U.S. Management is not projecting much improvement for the key holiday quarter, either: Wal-Mart U.S. expects flat comparable-store sales.|The key takeaway is that while economic headwinds are a big problem for Wal-Mart, they aren't the only problem. The warehouse segment is the only part of Wal-Mart that has an equivalent competitor, and Sam's Club is struggling even though Costco continues to grow steadily.|Nothing to cheer about hereTheoretically, Wal-Mart's size could be a huge competitive advantage, as it has unrivaled purchasing scale. However, the company may simply be too unwieldy to manage at this point. Whatever the cause, Wal-Mart seems to be drifting along with the U.S. economy, which over time could leave it at the mercy of more nimble competitors like Costco and Amazon.com.|Needless to say, I don't think investors should have Wal-Mart on their shopping lists. The stock is not especially cheap at 15 times current-year earnings, and the company is wholly reliant on share buybacks to drive EPS, as organic earnings growth has slowed to a crawl. Until Wal-Mart finds a way out of this morass, I would stay away.|"We" don't have an opinion... everybody at The Motley Fool is allowed to express his/her own ideas.

Amazon's sales are more than 64% from general merchandise. You could make the argument that the biggest threat to Amazon is the ability of retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) to leverage their superior physical presence into better sales. Wal-Mart has more domestic stores (around 4,000) than Amazon will likely ever have distribution centers. The company also generates billions in free cash flow , which Amazon does not. From an investor's perspective, Wal-Mart's 2.5% yield is something you don't get with Amazon.|The differences between Wal-Mart and Amazon, besides the number of locations, are almost too numerous to count. Amazon grew sales in the last quarter by more than 20%, Wal-Mart increased sales by just over 2%. Amazon still carries an operating margin around 1%, whereas Wal-Mart's margin is closer to 6%. Wal-Mart retired over 3% of its shares in the last year, while Amazon's share count increased. The two companies are very different, but they both are essentially retailers.|If we assume that Amazon would pay taxes at the same rate as Wal-Mart, the company's tax rate would be roughly 29 %. If by some miracle Amazon cut its fulfillment and technology expenses by two-thirds, could earnings really be spectacular?|The good news for investors is, technology expenses are similar to the warehouse expenses. Amazon has to outfit its new warehouses and upgrade its technology to keep up with demand from its Web Services division and expanding sales. With nearly $4 billion in expenses between the two categories, the company spent just over 22% of revenue. By comparison, Wal-Mart spent less than 20% of revenue on all of its selling, general, and administrative expenses. Based on this, It's not a stretch to believe that Amazon could cut its fulfillment and technology expenses significantly.

Wal-Mart is now presenting this touchy political subject as a factor that may dry up sales early next year when Americans will have to pay financial penalties if they're not insured.|This may seem an odd retailer to be bringing up Obamacare's impact on sales. Isn't Wal-Mart a magnet for the less-affluent who want to get more bang for their bucks? Medicaid and other subsidies will be available to the poor. The financial burden of bringing coverage to roughly 25 million uninsured people will fall largely on corporate America and the other classes until the ultimate goal of driving down overall health care costs is achieved.|However, that's a flawed assumption when it comes to Wal-Mart. Yes, it's a beacon for the less affluent, but the retailer claims that 60% of the U.S. shops at Wal-Mart in any given month. That's more than half the country!|The new penalties don't kick in until the end of March after a three-month grace period, but Wal-Mart's fear seems to be that some customers may hold back on their holiday spending until they get a clearer picture of what their budgets will look like come early 2014. There may be some truth to that, but it's hard to get excited about a retailer that has been a disappointment in terms of store-level comps for several years now. Wal-Mart's problems won't be made any easier by Obamacare, but it's not as if it wasn't struggling to drum up sales before any of this materialized.

Also, Costco has an advantage over a retailer such as Wal-Mart as it carries fewer items, as a result of which it needs fewer staff and hence, offers them far better wages as compared to Wal-Mart.|A Bloomberg report depicts how Wal-Mart has been in a soup due to lack of proper merchandising and disorganization. Shoppers are failing to find what they need at Wal-Mart stores, which, in turn, is a boon for peers such as Costco. Wal-Mart recently lowered its full year profit forecast and sales have fallen for three quarters straight. Its same-store sales in its recently reported quarter fell 0.3% in the U.S.|Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, which is a direct rival of Costco since it operates on an identical membership model, is also struggling. Comparable store sales at Sam's Club increased 1.1% in the previous quarter while analysts were looking for growth of 1.3%. Going forward, Wal-Mart expects Sam's Club same-store sales to range between flat and 2%. So, Costco has been doing better than Wal-Mart as far as comps growth is concerned and this outperformance could continue as it expands internationally.

Photo credit: Boeing.|Boeing (NYSE: BA) has been on a tear this year, with its stock price nearly doubling over the last 12 months. Concerns regarding a decline in Boeing's defense business have been overshadowed by the overwhelming demand for its commercial aircraft, where customers already have to wait years for their ordered products. This week boasts one of the aviation industry's biggest events, and Boeing is cleaning up at the Dubai Airshow.|Boeing launched its 777X program today with a record-breaking number of customer orders for the twin-aisle product. Commitments for 259 airplanes from four customers is a huge start to what looks to be a very successful product for Boeing. Emirates topped the orders by agreeing to purchase 150 airplanes; Qatar Airways took 50; Lufthansa 34, and Etihad Airways 25.|Those agreements combine to be worth more than $95 billion at list prices. That's a huge win for Boeing; to put the sum in perspective, it's worth more than Boeing's entire 2013 revenue estimate. Overall, Boeing's raked in 342 orders worth more than $100 billion at the airshow, while European rival Airbus managed 142 orders worth roughly $40 billion.|"We are proud to partner with each of these esteemed airlines to launch the 777X -- the largest and most-efficient twin-engine jetliner in the world," Boeing commercial airplanes president and CEO Ray Conner said in a press release. "Its ground-breaking engine technologies and all-new composite wing will deliver unsurpassed value and growth potential to our customers."|While the 777X has certainly stolen the show, it's not the only Boeing aircraft making headlines.|Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been a headache for those flying and for those investing.

For example:|Boeing|So all in all, investors need to decide if EADS's near 50% discount to Boeing is undervaluing the company. Even though there are concerns about global defense spending and the possibility that EADS defense division could see its earnings fall, it is likely that the rising demand for EADS' airbus divisions could offset this decline.|Having said all of that, some could argue that EADS' exposure to the defense market gives the company diversification outside of the traditional aerospace market. Whatever the case, I feel that EADS' current 50% discount to Boeing is too much.|Foolish summary Overall, demand for commercial aircraft is set to explode during the next two decades, and it would appear that EADS is in the best position to ride this trend. EADS' valuation is significantly lower than that of peer Boeing, despite both companies' similar market share. What's more, EADS' narrow-body aircraft are in demand, and the company's order backlog is testament to its reputation.

This largely centers around four companies; Boeing (BA - Analyst Report), Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer (ERJ - Analyst Report) which have a dominant position over the jet market.|However, these four are very different, as Boeing and Airbus dominate the large aircraft while Bombardier has a nice hold on the smaller vehicles (such as the business-focused Learjet brand). Meanwhile, Embraer generally fills the niche in between, zeroing in on smaller regional jets for most of its portfolio.|However, as airlines have combined, a new landscape has emerged. Generally speaking, new huge fuel-efficient jets have come on line from Boeing (787) and Airbus (A350), and as smaller planes have come back into vogue a bit, Embraer has largely been left in the dust.|Fortunately, there are other options in the aerospace/defense sector that might be better bets at this time. In particular, Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) and appears well-positioned to take advantage of the current trends in the market.

A big part of the Dow's bull-market run over the past four years has come from Home Depot (NYSE: HD) , and the home-improvement retailer will give its latest reading on the state of U.S. housing with its quarterly earnings report tomorrow. Given the impact of the housing market on the entire economy, Home Depot's results will have implications for the entire economy and could therefore have a big impact on how the Dow moves Tuesday.|Home Depot will release last quarter's numbers just after 6 a.m. EST tomorrow, before the market opens. It will follow the release with a conference call scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. EST.|Home Depot has been a huge leader since the Dow's 2009 lows, with its stock more than quadrupling in that four-and-a-half-year span. The fallout from the housing bust was predictably difficult for the retail chain, but Home Depot managed to recover even in a stagnant housing market by supporting renovation and remodeling efforts for customers' existing homes. It even managed to outpace rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) during much of that time, with Home Depot management doing a superior job in holding its own even through the toughest times. As the market hit bottom and started to rebound, Home Depot also capitalized on those seeking to make their properties as attractive as possible to potential buyers. Even though Lowe's has joined in those gains, it still lags behind its competitor in longer-term returns.|More recently, concerns about interest rates have halted Home Depot's rise. Traditionally, customers have used proceeds from mortgage refinancing as a pot of cash for remodeling projects, but the bottoming of interest rates earlier this year has dramatically reduced refinancing activity. Fellow Dow component JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and other banks have seen the impact of falling mortgage volume on their overall businesses. Home Depot is just one example of the collateral impact that rates could have in the years to come if the Federal Reserve starts easing back on its stimulative bond-buying activity.|Yet Fed chair nominee Janet Yellen did a good job of putting those fears to rest last week, with her Senate confirmation hearing offering an opportunity to stress her insistence on keeping rates low until the economy truly rebounds convincingly. If the broader bond market takes Yellen's words to heart, it could result in another leg down for rates and more opportunities for Home Depot to cash in.|Home Depot has supported the Dow's moves for years, and the news it gives investors tomorrow could once again move the average. For the Dow more broadly, signs that the housing industry is continuing to support the economy could keep the record-setting trend going throughout the average.|Keep building up your wealthHome Depot has done a great job of being a wealth-builder in recent years, but it's far from the only strong stock out there.

The company's stock has risen over 20% year-to-date, making it one of the top performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Let's take a look and see if we should be buying before the report or if we should wait to see what the company has to say before initiating a position.|The home improvement kingHome Depot is the largest home improvement specialty retailer in the world. It currently operates 2,258 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and Guam. The company was founded in 1978, went public in 1984, and has been a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1999.|Home Depot's earnings grew 22.8% and revenue rose 9.5% year-over-year, driven by an 11.4% increase in same-store sales. Management credited the strong results to increased sales in its seasonal categories, the continued rebound in the housing market, and strength in core product categories. The strong results caused management to raise its full-year guidance. Management now expects earnings to increase approximately 20% to $3.60, sales to increase 4.5% to $78.12 billion, and comparable store sales to increase 6% for the year. Overall, it was a great quarter that gave investors a bullish feeling about the company's performance for the rest of the year.|Earnings are expected to grow 20.3% and revenue is expected to rise 5.5% compared to the same period in 2012. Other than the key metrics, I would like to see Home Depot's margin expand and an update on the $17 billion share repurchase program currently in place. Also, it will be important to look at fourth quarter guidance and see management's views on home building, improvement, and remodeling activity. Overall, I am bullish on Home Depot going into the third quarter report.|Bullish indicator: Supplier strengthMasco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) , one of Home Depot's largest suppliers, reported third quarter results on October 28. The results exceeded analyst expectations and showed strong growth on both the top and bottom lines; earnings grew 92.9% and revenue rose 12.4% year-over-year. Management stated that strength in home improvement and remodeling projects were primary drivers for the great performance, which is basically saying that sales to Home Depot and Lowe's were the reason for increased sales. I believe that Masco's report along with its comments are some of the strongest indicators pointing toward an explosive quarter for Home Depot.|Competitor calenderLowe's (NYSE: LOW) is the second largest home improvement retailer in the world, with 1,758 home improvement stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The competition between this company and Home Depot used to be heated, but Home Depot has outpaced Lowe's same-store sales growth for 16 consecutive quarters, widening the gap by a very large margin.|On Aug. 21, Lowe's had a very impressive quarter in which earnings rose 37.5%, net sales rose 10.3%, and margins expanded. It is set to report third quarter results on November 20, so keep a close eye on Home Depot's report the day before as it may be a direct indicator of how Lowe's will report. With that said, I still prefer Home Depot over Lowe's as a long-term investment.|The Foolish bottom lineHome Depot is a great American company that has been building wealth for decades. It is undervalued based on forward estimates and could become even more undervalued after the quarterly report on November 19. The company also pays out a healthy 2% dividend which will provide additional returns to long-term investors. I believe Home Depot should be bought going into the report and on any weakness following this report or in the future. As always Foolish investors should do their own research before making any investment decisions.

Unfortunately, even the world's largest pharmaceutical is not immune to the loss of patents, and as soon as the company lost the exclusive manufacturing rights for the drug, Pfizer's profits collapsed 19%.|As of yet, Pfizer has not been able to recover from the loss of its best-selling drug. In particular, total revenue for the first nine months of this year fell 7% year on year as the company lost out to generic versions of both Lipitor and its Viagra drug.|Although the company has been hit hard by the loss of Lipitor, Pfizer still has the ability to research and develop new treatments that will hopefully fill the void. Indeed, the company currently has 81 new treatments within its development pipeline, up from 76 new treatments at the end of August. The company is investing heavily to stay ahead of the game.|All in all, while Pfizer's previous reliance upon Lipitor meant that the company did not look diversified, the subsequent loss of exclusive manufacturing rights for the drug has forced Pfizer to invest heavily in its treatment pipeline. Over time this should allow the company to develop a host of treatments that will increase the company's internal diversification and reduce its reliance on blockbuster drugs.

Valuation is actually a very tricky concept, and you can measure the worth of a company or stock in myriad ways. Verizon happens to be the richest-valued Dow Jones stock based on non-generally accepted accounting principles earnings power, but that's not necessarily the fairest measure of the company's true worth for investors.|For example, 27 of the 30 Dow components are expected to grow their earnings over the next year. Using forward-looking earnings estimates instead of the reported earnings in each company's rearview mirror, Verizon's P/E ratio falls to just 15.1 times forward estimates. That's the 14th largest ratio on the Dow, firmly in the middle of the pack. Merck still looks cheaper with a 13.7 forward P/E ratio, but the gap between the two stocks doesn't look all that massive anymore.|By this measure, Merck actually scores the highest number of any Dow stock. The medical giant's P/E ratio is more than five times larger than its estimated earnings growth. Verizon, on the other hand, sits at the center of the Dow once again with a 1.69 PEG ratio. Yes, the Dow average sits well above the ideal 1 level: Only two Dow stocks currently score below 1 on this value-oriented metric.|So it's easy to point to Verizon as the most expensive Dow Jones stock, but that's a pretty narrow view. The stock looks very fairly valued from several alternative angles, mostly because British telecom Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) grabs a very large share of the operating income from joint partnership Verizon Wireless -- Verizon's most profitable division by a long shot.

Verizon (NYSE: VZ) comes in next at 4.2%.|I have written in the past that while a stock's current yield is important to know for investors looking to buy new shares of a company, if you're already holding a stock, it's better to look at the price you paid for the stock and compare that amount with the current dividend, thus giving you a better idea of what your individual yield is. For example, somebody who bought AT&T back on Nov. 15, 1985, at an unadjusted share price of $6.65 would have a yield of 27% based on the current dividend of $1.80, not the posted 5.1% that investors buying today would garner.|So how has the stock price performed since AT&T started increasing its dividend in 1985?|On an unadjusted basis, someone who's held AT&T since 1985 would have experienced a 456% return, or 6.3% annualized (the calculation being based on the Oct. 31, 2013, closing price). That performance, though impressive, wouldn't beat the S&P 500's unadjusted return of 825%, or 8.3% annualized, over the same period. But reinvesting all of AT&T's dividends since 1985 raises the return to 1,835%, or 11.2% annualized. That beats even the S&P 500's dividend-adjusted return of 1,500%, or 10.44% annualized.|The futureSo AT&T's dividend has made the difference for investors during its 28-year run, but what can investors expect moving forward?|Of course, even the best company can fail. Not that AT&T is in imminent danger of going under, but the company is facing some headwinds in the near term, as growth in the U.S. wireless service industry begins to slow. Competitor Verizon has struggled to find growth within its domestic market and even turned to buying the 45% stake Vodafone held in Verizon Wireless as a way to grow its profits. Rumors also say AT&T may buy a European telecom company, while Verizon has supposedly been looking into purchasing a small Canadian firm.|The fact remains for now, though, that AT&T is the dominant player in the U.S. telecom market, and its position isn't really being challenged. The revenue flow it generates from users is safe and should continue to produce enough cash so that it can continue paying and increasing its dividend for a few more years. But looking further out, AT&T will need to grow its revenue stream, which means moving into new markets outside the United States if it wants to post 28 more years of yearly dividend increases.

Thomas Buffenbarger said.|Boeing said its timeframe for bringing the 777X into service "around the end of the decade" had not changed.|In a lengthy interview, the union leader defended the decision to put Boeing's offer to a vote and voiced concern that aerospace work in Washington state would dwindle sharply if the 777X were built elsewhere.|By rejecting the contract, the machinists opened the door for Boeing to consider building the jet outside the state, and prompted numerous states to work on proposals.|Now 31,000 machinists and thousands of other Boeing employees face potential job loss because the 777X is the only jet Boeing is likely to launch for the next 15 years.|But Buffenbarger said the union did not plan to make a counter offer. He also praised local IAM President Tom Wroblewski for putting the proposal to a vote because it showed what Boeing needs to offer to extend the contract and avoid the risk of a strike when the current labor deal ends in 2016.|"If Boeing wants to do a retest, talk to us. The ball is in their court."|Many investors still expect a labor deal, because it is far easier logistically to build the plane in Washington, where Boeing already builds the 777.|Buffenbarger acknowledged that Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney was serious about considering alternatives and may not allow further talks with the union on building the 777X in Everett.|Buffenbarger said Conner and Deal expressed the Boeing board's view that launch of the Airbus A350 went "a lot more smoothly than was anticipated. So they see stiffer competition now arriving earlier rather than later."|Customers such as Emirates airline, which is a big buyer of the current 777, are clamoring for the 777X to replace jets they plan to retire later in the decade. Emirates is expected to announce an order for at least 100 777X jetliners in the next few days at the Dubai Airshow, where Boeing is expected to formally launch the jet.|In September, the A350 won part of a major order from Deutsche Lufthansa that had been expected to go to Boeing. In October, longtime Boeing customer Japan Airlines ordered the A350 over Boeing's competing bid with the 777X.|To help attract the 777X, Washington state lawmakers passed an $8.7 billion package of tax breaks and other incentives that Boeing said was also necessary to bring the 777X to the state.|Buffenbarger said there was give-and-take in the talks. Boeing initially sought to extend the contract for 18 or 20 years, he said, but reduced that to eight years.|But it was Boeing's offer to replace the union pension with a 401(k)-style savings plan that drew strong objections from members who said their predecessors fought for that benefit.|Buffenbarger said it was fairest to take Boeing's best offer and let members decide.|"I'm still wrestling with the ramifications," he said, adding that other planes built at Boeing's massive Everett, Washington, factory are winding down and "you can only keep them on life support for so long."|NEW YORK, Nov 15- Boeing wants to speed up development of its newest jetliner because of the success of a rival plane from Airbus and sought to nail down a Seattle labor deal to help advance that aim, the machinists' union chief said in a Reuters interview on Friday.

Cisco has risen less than 10% this year, and a sizable dividend increase of its own has pushed its dividend yield up to almost 3.2%. Its poor earnings report last week helped send its shares plunging and its yield soaring, and some would argue that its projection of much weaker revenue in the current quarter makes it a poor investment prospect, at least in the short run. For longer-term investors, the main question remains whether Cisco can use its networking prowess to create a broader-reaching tech-services empire or whether it will fall prey to strong competition from its peers.|Caterpillar is one of just two Dow stocks to lose ground this year, and that has sent its yield up the most of any Dow stock, rising more than half a percentage point. The company has seen huge pressure both from lagging economic activity that has discouraged purchases of its construction equipment as well as from the plunge in commodity prices that have affected Caterpillar's mining-equipment demand. The only good news is that the entire industry is feeling similar pain, and any eventual cyclical rebound should help the stock recover -- albeit not necessarily even in 2014. Right now, Caterpillar stands No. 11 on the dividend-yield list, but with the likelihood of an end-of-year rally leaving the construction giant behind, Caterpillar stands a good chance of making the top 10 by year's end.

At the risk of jumping the gun, let's take a look at how Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) could end up on the list, and whether they'd make smart investments if they do.|3 Cs coming inFor Chevron, the interesting thing about the oil giant is that its yield hasn't budged since the beginning of the year. The stock has risen 11%, but Chevron announced a similarly sized dividend increase earlier in the year, keeping its yield unchanged.|So why could Chevron join the Dogs? The key is that with the overall Dow up sharply for the year, most of the current Dow Dogs have seen their share prices rise faster than their dividend payouts, reducing their yields. At the beginning of the year, 13 Dow stocks paid more than 3% yields, but now, only seven do. That puts Chevron, which has demonstrated a tenacious ability to boost its oil and gas production despite the challenges that its size presents, in a strong position to grow its dividend further and be a worthy dividend-stock contender in 2014.

Penney|Stocks rose to new record highs this week, with the S&P 500 and the narrower, price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) gaining 1.6% and 1.2%. Two of the biggest movers among large-capitalization stocks were technology stocks Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) -- although the former was a winner, while the latter lost ground. Meanwhile, shares of struggling retailer J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) had a very good week (the green line represents the S&P 500):|The current quarter has not been kind to Dow component Cisco Systems, which had been outperforming the S&P 500 last quarter. That outperformance has reversed sharply since the beginning of October, and last week saw the worst of that process, as Cisco Systems shares dropped 11% on Wednesday on the back of a fiscal first-quarter report that included dreadful guidance for the current quarter.|While this sort of negative surprise will probably weigh on Cisco's stock for several quarters, at its current valuation -- just under 11 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- it looks primed to reward investors who can adopt a multi-year time horizon. The company is hardly disdaining its shareholders, announcing a $15 billion increase in its share repurchase program. If you believe the shares are currently undervalued, that's a genuine source of value creation.

The Oracle of Omaha is one of the most famous and successful investors in the world, and recent news that his firm Berkshire Hathaway took a large stake in energy behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has shaken the investing world.|By several measures, ExxonMobil has the look of a classic Buffett stock. But, at the same time, there are lingering pressures on ExxonMobil that have put a dent in the company's underlying results this year. Should you follow Buffett into ExxonMobil? Or, on the other hand, would one of Exxon's peers better suit your investing preferences?|Securing the Buffett seal of approvalAccording to an SEC filing, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway added about 40 million shares of ExxonMobil, which at a recent price of $90 per share works out to a stake valued at more than $3.5 billion. As previously mentioned, there are plenty of reasons to believe ExxonMobil makes for a classic Buffett play. ExxonMobil has lagged both its industry and the broader market in year-to-date returns, and as a result trades for a pronounced discount to the market valuation.|This is because ExxonMobil has had a slew of operating issues this year, mostly involving its refining business. Narrowing spreads have severely affected refining margins, and profitability of refining activities has dropped off considerably this year. Consider that ExxonMobil's earnings fell 18% in the third quarter and are down 31% year to date.|Meanwhile, ExxonMobil's biggest U.S. competitor, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , has held up much better by comparison this year. Chevron is also suffering from the poor refining environment, but it was nevertheless able to post just a 4.5% decline in third quarter earnings. Year to date, Chevron's earnings are down a manageable 13%. That's because Chevron isn't as heavily reliant on downstream earnings as ExxonMobil.|Curiously, Berkshire Hathaway simultaneously trimmed its holdings of ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) almost in half. Buffett cut his stake from 24 million shares down to about 13.5 million shares, despite the fact that ConocoPhillips has performed much better than ExxonMobil this year (after spinning off its refining business).|Shareholder rewards likely caught the Oracle's eyeWhile it's true that ExxonMobil is struggling this year, management remains entirely confident that the company's troubles are short-term. In addition, ExxonMobil is an industry leader in terms of providing returns to shareholders. Exxon distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the third quarter alone, through dividends and share repurchases, and has increased its dividend for 31 consecutive years.|ExxonMobil repeatedly buys back billions of dollars of shares outstanding, which likely gave Buffett confidence that the stock offers a wide margin of safety, something the famed investor often looks for. ExxonMobil bought back more than $12 billion of its own shares through the first three quarters of 2013.|ConocoPhillips and Chevron maintain less aggressive buyback policies, instead favoring higher dividends as the means to provide cash to shareholders. ConocoPhillips and Chevron yield 3.7% and 3.3%, higher than ExxonMobil's 2.9% yield. But, for investors interested in an energy super-major that has the backing of the most famous investor in the world, ExxonMobil may be worth considering.

Merck's (NYSE: MRK) Zetia, for example, reduces LDL cholesterol by blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, and is used in some patients who don't achieve their LDL goals on statins alone. While trials have shown a beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol when added to statin therapy, it has not been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke in a clinical outcomes study. Merck is undertaking the IMPROVE-IT trial to prove that its Vytorin -- a Zetia/statin combo therapy -- does have a clinically relevant benefit, but until that trial reads out clinicians could cut back on Zetia/Vytorin prescriptions.|The news got even more interesting after I submitted this article for publication. As texasharleyguy shared above, the FDA seemed in part to be ok with not requiring PCSK9 outcomes studies, but then stated that they'll be watching Merck's IMPROVE-IT closely.

Trial results for Amgen's AMG145, Regeneron's alirocumab, and Pfizer's RN-316 have shown stellar results in mid-stage trials as statin add-ons and stand-alone monotherapies.

These orders would mark the best-selling product launch in the company's history, but it also marks a turning point in the global aviation market. Not only will these deals be inked in the United Arab Emirates, but the largest customers will be Middle Eastern airlines, demonstrating the region's increasing prominence and influence. The airlines and militaries of several Persian Gulf states, flush with oil money, are growing into one of the most important global markets in aviation and defense.|Historically, the aviation industry's biggest events have been the Paris Air Show in France and the Farnborough International Airshow in the U.K., prestige events where aeronautic and defense companies showcase their best offerings and rack up big orders. Over the past 20 years, however, the Dubai Airshow has risen from an obscure newcomer to challenge the biggest events in the business. In 2007, Dubai set the record for the largest order ever taken at an air show, and 2013 could cement its status as the most commercially important event of its kind in the world. Boeing's anticipated $100 billion in orders alone is equal to the 2013 Paris Air Show's entire sales total and nearly $30 billion more than Farnborough brought in.|The biggest driver of Boeing's sales in Dubai, the 777X, could take in as many as 250 orders, mainly from Gulf carriers Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad. The 777X will be the largest passenger jet ever with an unprecedented range up to 9,500 nautical miles. That's important for Middle Eastern airlines, which have smaller local markets for short-range flights than North America, China, Europe, or South America, but are well-positioned geographically to facilitate long-haul travel between continents. With a central position at the crossroads of Asia, Europe, and Africa, and astride routes connecting Asia to the Americas, Gulf airliners are positioning themselves as major intercontinental transportation providers. In fact, with the 777X Gulf airliners will be able to connect any two spots on the globe with just a single stopover in the Middle East.|Like Boeing for the dividend?Dividend stocks can make you rich.

While that may sound like bad news for Boeing, it's not. Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) , and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) all won contracts to develop next-gen planes, and these planes could be hitting the runway in 2025.|Concepts for the future In 2010, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing, Northrop, and Lockheed, to study advanced concept designs for aircraft that could take to the skies in 2025. Further, NASA stated that this plane has to "fly up to 85 percent of the speed of sound; cover a range of approximately 7,000 miles; and carry between 50,000 and 100,000 pounds of payload, either passengers or cargo." Moreover, it has to produce less noise, generate less pollution, and have 50% lower fuel consumption than the aircraft that entered service in 1998. No biggie, right? Well, here are three designs the defense giants came up with.|Boeing's concept is based on the blended-wing, remotely piloted X-48 -- which has already been shown to be particularly aerodynamic at NASA's Langley Research Center. Boeing also placed both of the turbofan engines on the back of the plane and coupled the aircraft with two vertical tails to reduce noise on the ground. Further, NASA stated that the aircraft "would feature an advanced lightweight, damage tolerant, composite structure; technologies for reducing airframe noise; advanced flight controls; hybrid laminar flow control, which means surfaces designed to reduce drag; and long-span wings which improve fuel efficiency."|What to watch Currently, all of these planes are concepts, but NASA has said it's committed to "make aircraft safer, faster, and more efficient and to help transform the national air transportation system," and it's taking steps to meet that objective. For Boeing, Northrop, or Lockheed, this could prove to be incredibly lucrative if NASA decides to pursue one of their designs, and help fund its continued research. Of course, that's a big "if," and as of now, it's too early to tell what will happen. Still, if I had to bet on seeing one company win NASA's next-gen plane, I'd bet on Boeing -- simply because it has the most experience with commercial aviation. Regardless, this is a story investors should continue to follow.

But were I to build a position in the group these days, I'd opt for Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , the U.S. majors' California-based second in command.

From the perspective of operating locations, its hot sports include the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Canada, Australia, and relatively stable Angola. It's distancing itself from the tinderbox that is Nigeria. And it remains the only major company working upstream with Saudi Aramco in the kingdom. Thus far it's managed to eschew direct involvement in Russia or increasingly chaotic Iraq.|Like Exxon, Chevron counts as a technological leader in the industry. For instance, its development of arcane new dual-gradient drilling increases safety and efficiency in the burgeoning world of deepwater operations. And I'm betting that many green energy aficionados would be surprised to learn that the company has developed several successful solar photovoltaic projects, and that it's the world's biggest producer of environmentally advantageous geothermal energy.|Foolish takeawayI could continue, perhaps noting that Chevron is oilier than its peers, which is a bad thing in dermatology but good in energy. I think you get the picture, however. Warren Buffett obviously has bestowed something of an imprimatur on the integrated model of Big Oil. That's fine. But if it provides you with an increased impetus to examine the group, don't neglect the compelling aspects of Chevron.

That said, as an E&P company, Conoco should have wider profit margins and be more desirable as an investment than even Exxon (the world's largest international oil company.)|However, there are some indications that Conoco deserves a premium over its larger cousins. The most prominent of these is the company's profit margin. Based on fiscal second quarter numbers, Conoco's operating margin stood at 28%. Chevron's operating margin was under 10%, while Exxon reported an operating margin of 16%. Higher-margin businesses usually demand higher premiums as they are obviously more lucrative.|I should also note that Conoco generates a cash margin of $40 to $45 per barrel on average for each barrel produced. Chevron, on the other hand, is averaging $23.88 as of the first half of 2013. This indicates that Chevron's production is significantly more expensive than that of Conoco.|Less spendingHang on, there's more! Not only is Conoco more profitable than its larger peers, but the company is also generating more free cash. Thanks to high capital spending as well as low returns from refining operations, Chevron and Exxon have been free cash flow negative during the first half of this year. Exxon in particular has had to bolster its cash flows with $7.8 billion in debt issuance during the first half of the year. Chevron has also been forced to rely on $7.8 billion in debt to boost cash flows during the same time period.|Meanwhile, Conoco's high-margin operations have kept cash generation high. As a result, the company has been able to pay back nearly $1 billion in debt during the first half of this year. That said, Conoco still has the highest net-debt-to-asset ratio of the trio, with net debt amounting to 15% of its assets. Still, the debt appears to be legacy, or pre-spinoff. As the company is paying down debt instead of increasing it like Exxon and Chevron, Conoco still appears to be the best of the bunch.|Foolish summaryAll in all, it would appear that Conoco does deserve a slight premium over its larger peers. Despite the fact that Conoco is relatively small compared to Exxon and Chevron, the company is more profitable and is managing capex spending more effectively.

"It almost mirrors olive oil in terms of the composition of fatty acids."|Because the new oils are liquids, they could not easily replace the partly hydrogenated oils used in baked goods, unless they are blended with other fats. So the best hope for Monsanto and DuPont might be to try to win back share that has been lost to palm, canola or other oils.|"We're sold out in 2013 and 2014," said John Jansen, vice president for regulatory, quality and innovation at Bunge, an oil manufacturer working with DuPont and Monsanto.|But there are grounds for skepticism. It has been more than three years since the Agriculture Department approved DuPont's Plenish soybeans for commercial planting and nearly two years since it approved Vistive Gold soybeans. Yet the crops are grown on only limited acreage, though that is partly by design until Europe grants permission to import the beans. And neither the seed companies nor the oil processors, citing confidentiality agreements, would name a single customer who is either using or testing the oils.|Moreover, Monsanto's and DuPont's previous attempts to market soybeans that would produce no trans fats, some of them developed with conventional breeding, faltered.|Monsanto, DuPont and oil processors say that the fact that the new beans are genetically engineered has not deterred potential customers. That could be because almost all soybeans and canola are already genetically engineered, to provide herbicide tolerance.|DuPont expects only 100,000 to 300,000 acres of Plenish soybeans to be planted next year, mainly in Indiana and Ohio, a tiny fraction of the nation's roughly 75 million acres of soybeans.

Home Depot went from being the second worst stock of the week to the best overall, simply on the belief that Janet Yellen, the heir apparent to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, will keep interest rates low for an extended period of time.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/16/should-home-depot-start-worrying-about-lowes-again.aspx|11/16/2013|0|"Home Depot"|0|Should Home Depot Start Worrying About Lowe's Again?|Home Depot (NYSE: HD) will release its quarterly report on Tuesday, and investors have ridden the home-improvement retailer's stock to massive gains ever since the housing market hit bottom. But after years of outperforming Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) , Home Depot now faces a potential new challenge from its arch-rival, and investors have to wonder whether Lowe's rebound could have an impact on Home Depot going forward.|Perhaps the most impressive thing about Home Depot's performance since 2009 is that the company posted strong gains even before the housing market showed signs of renewed strength. With its smart strategic vision, Home Depot managed to target key markets for remodeling and renovation as homeowners who were underwater on their mortgages couldn't trade up to new homes and therefore had to make the most of their current ones. Now that the housing market has rebounded, though, the question is where future growth will come from, and whether Lowe's will stand in the way of Home Depot's long dominance. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Home Depot over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Stats on Home Depot|How far can Home Depot earnings climb?In recent months, analysts have gotten more optimistic about Home Depot earnings prospects, boosting their October-quarter estimates by a penny per share but raising their fiscal 2014 and 2015 projections by a nickel and a dime per share respectively. The stock has done well in response, rising about 7% since mid-August.|Home Depot continued its positive momentum coming into the quarter, reporting July quarter results that showed the company's continued strength in leading the home-improvement retail industry. Same-store sales rose 10.7%, far outpacing already-ambitious growth estimates for the company, and strict cost-control measures helped push net income up more than 17%. A boost in guidance also pointed to better times ahead, although the increase still left Home Depot's projections somewhat short of what investors had hoped to see.|Part of what has made Home Depot investors increasingly nervous lately is the potential impact of rising mortgage rates on its business. Traditionally, homeowners have often taken on big projects after buying new homes or after getting infusions of cash from refinancing. As rates have risen, those factors have stopped working in Home Depot's favor, and further rate increases could put an end to the company's strong pace of growth.|Yet by many measures, Home Depot still has much further to run. With a sluggish recovery, many homeowners have deferred projects until they felt more financially stable, and that could lead to pent-up demand for home-improvement products in the future. Those same conditions should help Lowe's as well, and with Lowe's working to build tools that allow customers to plan their own projects more easily, Home Depot needs to stay aware of the importance of helping inexperienced do-it-yourselfers gain the confidence to tackle projects on their own.|One key for Home Depot's future success is not letting small niche retailers take over lucrative parts of its overall business. The rise of Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL) and Tile Shop (NASDAQ: TTS) in recent years has pointed to the opportunity for small players to specialize and capture substantial market share, but Home Depot can nevertheless compete on volume as well as emphasizing its one-stop shopping advantages that help shoppers avoid having to go to multiple stores in order to find what they need for all their projects.|In the Home Depot earnings report, watch to see how well the company does in holding off both Lowe's and some of its niche rivals. To keep rising to new highs, Home Depot needs to demonstrate its ability to stay focused on both contractors and ordinary homeowners to make the most of its dual opportunity.|How to rebuild your portfolioTo gain back your portfolio losses from five years ago, growth stocks like Home Depot have been extremely useful in providing strong gains.

While going through all of the interesting information about the company, I discovered that there were more facts to talk about than what I had room to write. So, to atone for my intentional omission of information, I wrote this article to inform the Foolish investor about some more things you likely didn't know about the world's favorite beverage maker.|Coca-Cola goes digital!First, electronics go digital, followed by clothing sales! What's next? Movies? Oh wait... scratch that. As shopping has moved more toward shopping online, so too has Coca-Cola moved to advertising online. On top of sporting an online store and advertising via platforms like Facebook, Coca-Cola has taken it upon itself to marketing its products in the world of videogames.|In PlayStation Home, a virtual world created by Sony (NYSE: SNE) for the PlayStation 3, there is a Coca-Cola vending machine that can transport users to the game's Georgia Break Station. There, they would lounge and be told about the company's new Georgia canned coffee product. On top of this, the vending machine would give out avatar apparel and real coupons that could be used with actual vending machines to get drinks.|Coca-Cola moves to the big screen... literally!If dominating the world of beverages wasn't enough, Coca-Cola found the opportunity to jump into the movie business. In 1982, as Columbia Pictures was struggling, the company came in and acquired it for $693 million. This was, and remains to this day, the only non-beverage acquisition the company has made.|Before selling 51% of the company to Tri-Star in 1987 to the tune of $3.1 billion, the production studio released a number of big-name releases. These included Ghostbusters, The Karate Kid, and Ishtar. However, Coca-Cola's ownership in the studio ended in 1989 when Sony finally acquired the combined Tri-Star/Columbia Pictures enterprise for $3.4 billion.|Things are different overseasAs of the company's 2012 fiscal year end, it earned 45.1% of its operating revenues from within its North America segment, while the next largest (excluding its Bottling Investments segment) is its Pacific one at 11.6%. This data point is impressive and stands as a testament to Coca-Cola's foothold in this region. However, it's the other regions that are interesting to me since that's where most of the company's future growth prospects likely are.|For instance, while Coca-Cola has a leading market share in the beverage business in the United States, it only controlled about 12% of the non-alcoholic drink market in the Middle East in 2011. In comparison, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) had an 85% market share. Likewise, in Japan, the company's namesake product isn't anywhere near as popular as its Georgia tea, as both tea and coffee products are more preferred in this region.|C'mon... everybody does it...Due to the nature of politics, a lot of major companies lobby in an attempt to preserve their business and, at times, to try and make business easier. Coca-Cola is no different, but its lobby activities have increased rapidly over the past several years.|In 2006, the company spent $1 million on lobbying. However, due to increased interest aimed at scaling back SNAP (food stamp) benefits on unhealthy food items and raising taxes on various beverages, Coca-Cola has ramped up its spending to as much as $9.4 million in 2009. On top of this, the company donated, in 2012, over $1.7 million toward fighting off California's Proposition 37, which would require companies with genetically modified ingredients to label them under their nutrition information.|However, Coca-Cola isn't the only company in the industry to see an increase in lobbying expenditures. In 2009, PepsiCo also spent roughly $9.4 million on lobbying. This represents a significant rise from the $1.2 million the company spent on lobbying in 2008.|Foolish takeawayAs we can see, Coca-Cola is a fascinating company. In addition to facing different consumer tastes across the globe and political headwinds at home, the company has a rather innovative past of advertising and even had the bravery to jump into an industry that had nothing to do with its core business. I don't know about you, but I think that a company this interesting deserves a Foolish look.

As a result, here's the big decision investors need to make.|Among the major soda purveyors, it's understandable to consider Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) as one-and-the-same. After all, their namesake sparkling beverages have competed against each other for decades, and together they've dominated the soda business.|One company takes a strategic turnPepsi appears to be the one accepting the fact that consumers want to live healthier lifestyles. In response, several years ago Pepsi slowly built a portfolio of brands outside its previous core competency. Well-known brands that are now under the Pepsi umbrella include Gatorade, Quaker, and Frito-Lay. Right now, Pepsi's revenue is almost evenly split between food and beverages. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola still derives the vast majority of its sales from sparkling beverages.|As far as Pepsi's strategy is concerned, the results speak for themselves. Pepsi grew revenue and earnings per share by 2% and 12%, respectively, over the first nine months of 2013. Compare this to Coca-Cola, whose revenue and EPS both fell 2% through the first three quarters of the year. While Coca-Cola remains a blue-chip company that registers hefty profits year in and year out, there's no denying the company's underlying results have hit a snag.|To be fair, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have richly rewarded shareholders over many decades. Both companies have paid and increased their dividends for many years in a row. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have increased their dividends for 51 and 41 consecutive years, respectively. And, each stock yields roughly 2.7%, which is better than the 2% payout of the broader market.|If dividends are your primary concern, Dr Pepper Snapple (NYSE: DPS) might be for you. That's because Dr. Pepper Snapple yields 3.2%, significantly above both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, as well as the overall market.

There appears to be a winner of the soda wars, at least for the time being: Pepsi.|Among the major soda purveyors, it's understandable to consider Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) as one-and-the-same. After all, their namesake sparkling beverages have competed against each other for decades, and together they've dominated the soda business.|One company takes a strategic turnPepsi appears to be the one accepting the fact that consumers want to live healthier lifestyles. In response, several years ago Pepsi slowly built a portfolio of brands outside its previous core competency. Well-known brands that are now under the Pepsi umbrella include Gatorade, Quaker, and Frito-Lay. Right now, Pepsi's revenue is almost evenly split between food and beverages. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola still derives the vast majority of its sales from sparkling beverages.|As far as Pepsi's strategy is concerned, the results speak for themselves. Pepsi grew revenue and earnings per share by 2% and 12%, respectively, over the first nine months of 2013. Compare this to Coca-Cola, whose revenue and EPS both fell 2% through the first three quarters of the year. While Coca-Cola remains a blue-chip company that registers hefty profits year in and year out, there's no denying the company's underlying results have hit a snag.|To be fair, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have richly rewarded shareholders over many decades. Both companies have paid and increased their dividends for many years in a row. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have increased their dividends for 51 and 41 consecutive years, respectively. And, each stock yields roughly 2.7%, which is better than the 2% payout of the broader market.|If dividends are your primary concern, Dr Pepper Snapple (NYSE: DPS) might be for you. That's because Dr. Pepper Snapple yields 3.2%, significantly above both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, as well as the overall market.

Nike (NYSE: NKE) , Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Walgreen (NYSE: WAG) have the fundametal strenght to continue rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for years to come and are definitely worth a closer look by Foolish investors looking for rock solid dividend picks.|The company has been facing stagnant volume growth in developed markets due to market saturation and the trend toward healthier nutrition. But Coca-Cola is focusing on alternatives like sports drinks and waters to adapt to changing consumer habits in those countries, while emerging markets are still offering plenty of room for volume growth in both traditional carbonated drinks and healthier choices.|Coca-Cola is part of the Dividend Aristocrats Index, a select group of companies which has been able to increase dividends over the last 25 consecutive years. Even better, Coke makes most of its peers in the Dividend Aristocrats index look like simple plebeians with its amazing track record of 51 consecutive dividend increases in a row.|Bottom line A solid track record of dividend increases is one of the most desirable characteristics dividend-loving investors can find in a company.

The company fell short of consensus revenue and earnings estimates -- a result that is indicative of the sluggish growth experienced by all energy drink brands, including those owned by Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) .|Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are playing second fiddleIf Monster can get past the negative publicity and escape regulatory scrutiny with limited advertising restrictions, it has a bright future. The meteoric growth of the previous decade may not persist, but the company can sustain market leadership for years to come. Monster's closest competitor is Red Bull; the two are currently neck-and-neck in terms of market share. Rockstar, NOS, and AMP are far behind the two, suggesting that Monster and Red Bull will become the Coca-Cola and PepsiCo of the energy drink market when the dust finally settles.|Coca-Cola and PepsiCo's inability to gain a leading share of the energy drink market is not for lack of trying. Coca-Cola's most successful brands include Full Throttle and NOS, neither of which comes close to Monster in terms of market share. PepsiCo markets AMP and Kickstart -- both are promising brands but neither has made a serious run at Monster and Red Bull. The beverage giants' poor showing in the energy drink segment is likely due to their marketing tactics -- Red Bull and Monster already dominate the extreme sports arena, leaving Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to battle it out in less fanatical customer segments. As a result, neither Coca-Cola nor PepsiCo is likely to gain much traction except through acquisitions.|Ted Cooper has no position in any stocks mentioned.

If given the choice, most wireless subscribers would probably prefer not to sign a two-year agreement, and instead go month-to-month. On Verizon Wireless, for example, a month-to-month plan with 2GB of data is just $60 -- the equivalent plan on contract is $100, and getting out of it requires paying early termination fees.|Google has a solution: the Nexus phones. The new Nexus 5 is quite capable, works with all major carriers (except Verizon), and, most importantly, costs just $349 off contract. Most reviewers have been kind to Google's phone; Business Insider's Steve Kovach even went so far as to say it's the only Android phone you should buy.|T-Mobile's rapidgrowthRecent trends at T-Mobile support Google's strategy. Last quarter, the company added roughly 1 million subscribers, outpacing rivals AT&T and Verizon. This is notable, because T-Mobile no longer offers phone subsidies. Instead, T-Mobile encourages subscribers to buy their phones upfront, bring their own phone to the service, or pay for it in monthly installments.|This is not good for the iPhone. On T-Mobile's recent earnings call, CEO John Legere admitted as much, remarking that last quarter, Apple's iPhone accounted for just 21% of the phones T-Mobile sold. In contrast, of Verizon's phone activations, a full 51% of them were iPhones. There could be other reasons to explain the discrepancy -- perhaps Apple fans are just more likely to sign up with Verizon -- but I believe that the different approach to phone subsidies is a major factor.|But Google could. The trend toward cheap yet powerful unlocked Nexus phones could result in the signing of fewer two-year contracts, particularly if Google continues to emphasize the handset in the coming quarters and can get future Nexus phones to work with more networks (notably Verizon's). T-Mobile's recent growth suggests that consumers are eager to ditch the standard two-year contract.|First T-Mobile sold alot of iPhones. But they are expensive. But they will finance the phones and with T-Mobile being much cheaper than Verizon, they are still affordable.|I have 5 phones with Verizon. I pay over $ 300 with 2 Gig of data. I checked into T-Mobile, MetroPCS and they both had great deals. Metro had a deal for 4 phones with unilmited 3G and 500 minutes of 4G for $ 100 no taxes. In many cities the service works well. Outside is questionable. Customer service is almost non-existant.|Those that need to make due with less will go to these carriers. Those that need to have a good signal more often then not will chose carriers like Verizon. It is a trade off. Now if T-Mobile service improves, they will have more people who will afford an iPhone.|Verizon Wireless, for example, a month-to-month plan with 2GB of data is just $60 -- the equivalent plan on contract is $100, and getting out of it requires paying early termination fees. This not the same service as the one you receive on contract. I had it for 1 month and it was horrible. They admitted to me it was a reduced service, and you could be restricted during high use times.

Same-store sales in the U.S. were down 0.3% at Wal-Mart stores last quarter, and Sam's Club experienced just a 0.1% rise. Wal-Mart said it would be fighting for every dollar it could from consumers, but investors should wonder if this is this a precursor to a terrible holiday season.|So far, the market has barely reacted, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was actually up 1.3% for the week. Year to date, the Dow is up 24.5%, but can this continue if consumers aren't spending this holiday season? While Wal-Mart isn't a perfect bellwether for the Dow, it is a measure of how the broader economy is doing. If Wal-Mart is struggling, it's bad for every stock on the market, isn't it?|Holes emerge in Wal-Mart's plans Wal-Mart just reported its third straight quarter of falling same-store sales, usually the first sign a retailer is in trouble. Wal-Mart's plan to fix its problem includes cutting costs, which is part of its problem in the first place.|Image: Wal-Mart.|I highlighted last month that bothTarget (NYSE: TGT) and Costco are outgrowing Wal-Mart, in part because they have better merchandise and better stores.

If there's a way to make falling same-store sales get worse, it's by having less inventory and fewer staff.|Wal-Mart's problems may be self-inflicted, but that doesn't mean it will be a great holiday for retailers.|But the bigger factor affecting retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target will be the growth of online retail. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't expecting a bad holiday season, and that's bad news for traditional retailers.|Something's got to give Online sales are growing, and those sales have to come from somewhere. Amazon has vastly outgrown Wal-Mart and Target over the past five years, which wasn't a big deal when Amazon was a $7 billion company -- but it is a big deal now that it has $70 billion in sales.|Each percentage point of growth for Amazon is a loss for discount retailers. This is a zero-sum game, and not everyone can grow on the back of limited consumer dollars. If Wal-Mart or any other brick-and-mortar retailer wants to complain about sales growth this holiday season, it may be better to look at online retailers rather than the death of the consumer.|Foolish bottom line Given weakness in the economy as a whole, I don't think any retailer should expect outstanding numbers this holiday season. But we can't assume that just because Wal-Mart does poorly, the rest of the retailers are having a bad year. They may just be losing sales to online retailers.|Is this the death of Wal-Mart?Wal-Mart may be on its last leg, but people aren't done buying goods from all retailers.

http://www.cnbc.com/id/101202361|11/15/2013|0|"Cisco Systems"|1|Cisco this week became the one of the first companies to say publicly that its sales were down as a direct result of the NSA disclosures. The issue is whether overseas clients are reluctant to buy Cisco's telecommunications equipment for fear that the organization would gain access to their systems.|On an investor conference call Wednesday, Benjamin Reitzes of Barclays Capital asked Cisco CEO John Chambers whether the allegations had caused a slump in Cisco's emerging market business, adding, "It is an impact in China."|"I think we're all aware of that." said Robert Lloyd, Cisco's president of development and sales. "It's not having material impact, but it's certainly causing people to stop and then rethink decisions. And that is, I think, reflected in our results."

The stock is now down around 20% from its yearly high in August. With the mid-point of its 2014 guidance implying a 1% fall in earnings, is now the time to give up on the stock, or to buy in?|Cisco's nasty quarterCisco beat earnings estimates for the quarter but missed revenue expectations, and its near-term outlook is horrible. Its orders in the quarter were $600 million -- $700 million short of its own expectations -- a problem for a company with 70% of product revenues dependent on new orders each quarter. With this shortfall in place, its second-quarter EPS guidance of $0.45-$0.47 came in nearly 8% below analyst estimates at the mid-point.|First, Cisco basically repeated what IBM (NYSE: IBM) said earlier in the earnings season with regard to demand in emerging markets. Both companies had reported some second-quarter weakness in the BRICs, but IBM's disclosure that its Chinese sales declined 22% in the third quarter -- with hardware down 40% -- was a big surprise.|Fast-forward to Cisco's third-quarter results, and the weakness seems to have spread out. Here is CEO John Chambers on the subject:|Frankly, it's puzzling as to why Cisco's performance in emerging markets was so weak across the board. China was down 18% -- in line with what IBM reported -- but why should Russia and Brazil be down 30% and 25%, respectively?|One possible answer can be construed from something that CEO Chambers mentioned in the conference call. He argued that Cisco went into the last month of the previous quarter "a little bit off the numbers we expected." But in the last two weeks of the quarter, its orders came in $300 million more than forecast. It's possible that Cisco's emerging market weakness was exacerbated in this quarter because in the previous quarter its sales people pushed hard to make the numbers.|The second issue was the 14% fall in service-provider video revenues, while orders also disappointed with a 13% decline. Cisco's set-top box sales declined 20%, and since they make up 20% of revenue from service providers -- which makes up more than 8% of total revenue -- the impact was significant. Cisco's challenge is to manage the transition from traditional set-top boxes toward its set-top boxes that connect with the cloud. In fact, this has been an ongoing issue this year. It seems that sales of its new products were disappointing, and Cisco continued to follow a policy of "walking away" from low-profit deals with the older technology. Good for margins, terrible for revenue growth.|First, Cisco described its U.S. enterprise and commercial growth as being very strong and cited order growth in the high single digits. This matches what Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) said at its earnings in September. Oracle saw its new software-license and cloud subscriptions rise 14% in America. This is a sign that the U.S. -- particularly in enterprise -- is the standout region for IT spending growth. It's a good sign for U.S. growth.|Second, the set-top box issue is a structural problem, but Cisco is managing it, and has products in place. Further, plenty of IT companies see some issues when they introduce new products or make transitions in technology. Companies can be reticent to spend on an old system when a new one is available, yet also careful not to rush to buy and integrate a new technology. However, provided the underlying demand is there, these issues can be sorted out in a few quarters. For example, tech companies like F5 Networks and Check Point Software have seen these issues over the last year.|Third, Cisco was obviously disappointed with its performance in emerging markets, particularly late in the quarter. This means it's likely that the updated guidance has been reset with current trading in mind. If BRIC spending picks up, then Cisco could surprise on the upside going forward. In any case, emerging-market demand does tend to be volatile.|Finally, the company has $48.2 billion in cash and cash-like investments, while total debt is only $16.2 billion. In other words, its net cash of $32 billion represents around 29% of its market cap. Cisco has the resources to make earnings-enhancing acquisitions.|Time to buy Cisco?Cisco is going to attract value hunters. Even on its disappointing $1.95-$2.05 EPS guidance, the stock still sells at a P/E ratio of around 10.5 times forward earnings. It's not the highest-quality technology company out there, but it's cheap, and it has opportunities to turn around its fortunes. Throw in a near-3% dividend yield and you can enjoy some income while you wait.|Cisco pays dividends, and so do these Dow componentsIf you're looking for some long-term investing ideas, you're invited to check out The Motley Fool's brand-new special report, "The 3 Dow Stocks Dividend Investors Need."

Far from a high-growth momentum play, Exxon has actually languished until recently, as concerns about its ability to sustain production levels kept many investors from looking at the integrated oil giant.

In addition to specific proprietary factors, Trade-Ideas identified Exxon Mobil Corporation as such a stock due to the following factors:|Exxon Mobil Corporation engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas, and manufacture of petroleum products. The company also transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. It has approximately 37,228 gross and 31,264 net operated wells. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.7%. XOM has a PE ratio of 12.1. Currently there are 4 analysts that rate Exxon Mobil Corporation a buy, 1 analyst rates it a sell, and 9 rate it a hold.|The average volume for Exxon Mobil Corporation has been 12.7 million shares per day over the past 30 days. The stock has a beta of 0.84 and a short float of 0.9% with 3.57 days to cover. Shares are up 7.1% year to date as of the close of trading on Tuesday.|TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Exxon Mobil Corporation as a buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its attractive valuation levels, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and increase in stock price during the past year.

U.S. regulators force large investors like Buffett to disclose their stock holdings every quarter for greater transparency. On Thursday, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) reported its 13-F filing for the quarter ended Sept. 30.|Due to the size of Exxon, roughly $408 billion in market capitalization, Buffett's position represents just 0.9% of the company's shares. However, it is nonetheless a sign of strong support by one of the world's most savvy investors. For Buffett, the purchase is significant to say the least. Exxon shares will now represent roughly 4% of the $99.5 billion in the publicly disclosed stock portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway. Using current figures, this would make Berkshire Hathaway the sixth largest shareholder in the company.|Buffett has historically loved investing in well established, prominent and lagging names within the market. Exxon seems to fit his investing strategy well and will offer easy exposure to the global energy space for Berkshire. A couple weeks ago Exxon reported a mixed third quarter result. Profit in the third quarter dropped to $7.87 billion, $1.79 per share, from $9.57 billion, or $2.09 per share, in the third quarter of last year. While company profits may have declined, output rose for the first time in two years as a result of the company's new projects. Oil and natural gas output rose 1.5% to 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Weaker refining margins and throughput hurt the company's downstream results. The downstream segment recorded profit of $592 million in the third quarter in comparison to $2.6 billion in the third quarter of last year.

Thus, in the third quarter of the year Buffett bought more Exxon-Mobil(XOM) and lightened up on Conoco-Phillips(COP), which spun-out its refinery operations in 2012.|Exxon-Mobil bought a huge gas producer called XTO Energy four years ago, and has since been adding to that holding, becoming the largest producer of natural gas in the country.|There is enormous arbitrage to be done in natural gas, as shown in this chart from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Markets in Asia and South America are paying four times more for the product than Americans are. Exporting gas is a capital-intensive business, but Exxon-Mobil has lots of capital.|Exxon-Mobil is also the world's largest oil refiner, handling nearly 5.8 million barrels per-day according to Petro Strategies. Refining is another way to arbitrage fuel prices. The "spread" between U.S. and world oil prices has been widening since summer and is now about $13/barrel. This means Exxon-Mobil can export refined products at a solid profit.|Exxon-Mobil also has lots of oil, with proven reserves worth $2.2 trillion according to recent estimates. This puts a floor under the equity value of $411 billion. Buffett's downside risk here is very limited.|Buffett has also displayed his typical good timing in entering this opportunity. Exxon-Mobil has been heavily-shorted lately and this provides lift to the shares. Technical indicators are positive.|Exxon-Mobil's liquidity means this is a stock Buffett can play for either the short-term, as a trade, or for the longer-term, as an investment. The natural gas market has turned from boom to bust and is ripe for a financial consolidation. The oil industry is following the same path.|This is the history that built Standard Oil. Exxon was formerly Standard Oil-New Jersey and Mobil was once Standard Oil-New York. Together they're the best-positioned, most-undervalued play out there to drive a new wave of energy industry consolidation, based on downstream infrastructure and capital availability.

For three straight days, you're going to hearing nothing except how great Exxon is because of the big buyback and Warren Buffett likes it. So, why don't you wait three days, then sell, sell, sell."|Oppenheimer oil analyst Fadel Gheit told Reuters that Buffett "likes buying big, established global brand names, and Exxon is a good flight-to-quality stock...

The most significant piece of information in the disclosure is a significant new position in energy supermajor ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , to the tune of 40.1 million shares worth $3.4 billion at the end of last quarter.|However, true to form as a stock picker, Buffett is not simply making a broad bet on the energy sector; he likes ExxonMobil specifically. This is evident in yesterday's filing: Berkshire has reduced its stake in ExxonMobil competitor ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) by some 44%.|In his defense, ConocoPhillips' stock looked extremely cheap during the third quarter of 2008, trading at an average premium of just 20% over its book value (the equivalent premium for ExxonMobil during that period was 223%). And the shares have hardly been a disaster since then; in fact, they've essentially matched the S&P 500 in a strong bull market (though with greater volatility).|Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has substantially lagged the index over the same period, but most of that underperformance has opened up this year. While the shares continue to trade at a substantial premium to those of ConocoPhillips, that gap has narrowed significantly; as of yesterday's close, Exxon's book value multiple is 2.41 against 1.77 for ConocoPhillips.|In truth, ExxonMobil always looked like the better fit within Berkshire's equity portfolio: The company is singularly focused on economic profitability and returning profits to shareholders. Now, following a period of stock underperformance, Buffett is signaling that the price is right -- watch for that underperformance to narrow and, ultimately, reverse over the next several years.|ExxonMobil and a select group of other stocks can make you rich -- here's howDividend stocks can make you rich.

The Exxon Mobil buy was not Buffett's first array into Big Oil investing, and it will not likely be his last. This is due to there being no industry better situated to profit from growth in Asia than the energy sector.|At present, Buffett, considered by many to be the best investor ever, has major positions in Suncor Energy(SU) and ConocoPhillips(COP). Due to the "Buffett Effect," the shares of each surged after that news became public. Over the last six months of market action, Suncor is up nearly 15%. For the same period, the share price of ConocoPhillips increased by more than 20%. But shares of Exxon Mobil rose by less than 3% for the same time segment; the major exchange-traded fund for oil, United States Oil (USO), was down slightly.|The Asia angle is starting to play more into Buffett's investing, and has certainly factored into his Exxon Mobile buy. Recent investments in Lubrizoil, Heinz, ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy, Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railways and others will all profit from growth in Asia. In 2011, he made his first trip to India, and, as reported by the BBC News Business, "Mr. Buffett has been bullish on Asia's growth and has invested in companies in Korea, China and India."|According to a earlier report by the U.S. Energy Information Agency, about two-thirds of the growth in demand for energy in the future will be from emerging markets, primarily in Asia. As detailed here on TheStreet, the International Energy Agency, in its World Energy Outlook, projects that transportation and chemicals will be the two industries consuming the most fuel, led by Asian nations. Exxon Mobil is ideally situated to serve both of those markets, with particular recognition of the importance and potential of the markets in China, India and other countries in Asia.|In a speech to the Asia Society Global Forum in June, Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil, stated that "As North American oil production increases and the need for imports fall, more of the oil produced in the Middle East and elsewhere is available to serve Asian growth. This is important because between now and 2040, Asian oil demand will likely grow by about 15 million barrels a day -- with the share of demand served by imports into the region rising to around 80%. So the rebalancing of supplies, made possible by increased North American production, is providing more stability and security around the globe."|With the Exxon Mobil investment, Warren Buffett has positioned Berkshire Hathaway to gain more from global growth. That is especially so for the increasing demand for energy in Asian markets. Investors should expect not only more energy investments from Buffett in the future, especially those that profit from growth in Asia.

Lipitor was so popular that it was at one time the world's best-selling drug, raking in $9 billion in annual sales for Pfizer. Total lifetime sales for Lipitor stands at a whopping $140 billion, easily dwarfing Bristol-Myers Squibb's second-placed blood thinning drug Plavix with about $74 billion lifetime sales.|From a high of $9 billion per year, Pfizer managed to sell Lipitor worth only $3.9 billion in 2012, aptly demonstrating how badly loss of exclusivity hits their owners. In the one year Lipitor faced full competition from generic drug manufacturers, global Lipitor sales tanked a full 59%, while sales in the U.S. fell a jaw-dropping 81%. Luckily for Pfizer, its overall revenues fell ''just'' 8.8% in 2012, mainly because it derived about 15% of its revenues from Lipitor. Teva gets 21% of its revenues from Copaxone.|That's huge by any yardstick. The negative effects on its revenues is likely to be more keenly felt than at Pfizer, since it relies more heavily on Copaxone for its sales revenues.|ConclusionIn my opinion, Teva's risks outweigh its potential rewards. Although the stock is cheap, the lack of any clear growth is a major cause for concern. Teva is already pushing the U.S. Supreme Court to have Copaxone's patent expiration pushed back to 2015 instead of the planned May 2014. Pfizer did manage to have Viagra's patent expiration pushed back till 2020. If the company succeeds in its appeal, then it will buy itself one more year before generic manufacturers swoon in with their Copaxone generics.

Let's review.|Pfizer to the rescue?In January Repligen announced that it had entered into a $70 million collaboration with Pfizer to develop its SMA program. The out-licensing netted the company a $5 million upfront payment while a $1 million milestone was achieved during the third quarter. There is quite a long road ahead for Pfizer, but Repligen could generate sizable milestone and royalty revenue in the next few years if the program is successful.|While there may be a healthy amount of milestone payments involved in the Pfizer collaboration, the unpredictability and lengthiness of clinical trials makes it impossible to count on SMA products replacing Orencia's lost revenue. I would focus on bioprocessing product sales growth and count milestone payments as freebies. If they happen, great. If not, it's not the end of the world.

Others say it's a sign of the times, that the rich are getting richer and heading off to Macy's(M). Some say the company is just politically incorrect, and the left side of our political aisle is staying away.|In fact, the answer is simpler. Wal-Mart has exhausted its original target market.|Wal-Mart has also tried to fight the trend by expanding overseas, but that can also be self-limiting. Some markets, like India, just don't want Wal-Marts. The same real estate problems bedeviling the company in the U.S. count double in Europe. The problems of Mexico, where Wal-Mart paid $157 million over a probe into bribery, illustrate another risk.|Wal-Mart has sought to break out of the box by expanding online. It's now the second-largest online retailer behind Amazon.Com(AMZN). That's going to be a hard fight to win.|Wal-Mart is trying to break into urban markets with smaller stores. Whether called a Walmart Neighborhood Market, a Supermercado de Walmart or a Walmart Express it's a work in progress, with serious competition.|Competition is what all these efforts have in common. Wal-Mart owns its niche. It's trying to take others' niches. That takes specialized market knowledge, and investment, that takes time to pay off. It's not as easy as throwing up a slab on some farmland and bringing in the panel trucks.|Finally, Wal-Mart is trying to compete with itself, with its past success. Success is not easy to sustain. You come up with a great idea in retailing, whether that involves logistics or merchandising, and everyone else starts using it, too. Wal-Mart hopes low, low prices can get it through Christmas. We have heard that jingle before.|A merchant has to run very, very hard just to stay in place. At Wal-Mart, international sales for its third quarter were up 4.1% to $34.4 billion, excluding any currency impact, according to Reuters. If we subtract that number out of total revenue, we get a back-of-envelope number for overall U.S. sales of more than $80 billion, or roughly $27 billion per month. Total U.S. retail sales for September was just short of $380 billion.|Some traders are betting on those big numbers. But big numbers have a downside. Wal-Mart has just gotten too big to grow fast.

For example, two years ago, WalmartLabs met the founders of a startup called Grabble as they were in SiliconValleypitching their technology that enables customers to get receipts for their purchases by email. Wal-Mart has since bought the startup, hired the founders, and next year, shoppers will be able to get the so-called e-receipts.|The company says it's so pleased with its results at WalmartLabs that it plans to open another tech office in nearby Sunnyvale in January.

For instance, Wal-MartLabs developed technology that enables Wal-Mart's mobile app to show products and give discount offers to customers based on the aisle they're in. It also developed technology that enables the mobile app to track customers' spending based on a predetermined budget.|Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., says having a presence in Silicon Valley has been invaluable in part because it offers the company early access to technology entrepreneurs. For example, two years ago, Wal-MartLabs met the founders of a startup called Grabble as they were in Silicon Valley pitching their technology that enables customers to get receipts for their purchases by email. Wal-Mart has since bought the startup, hired the founders, and next year, shoppers will be able to get the so-called e-receipts.|The company says it's so pleased with its results at Wal-MartLabs that it plans to open another tech office in nearby Sunnyvale in January. It also has smaller tech hubs elsewhere. "We are not a retailer in Silicon Valley," says Neil Ashe, CEO of Wal-Mart's global e-commerce operations. "We are building an Internet technology company inside the largest retailer."

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/14/does-the-boeing-company-machinists-union-vote-leav.aspx|11/14/2013|0|"Boeing"|4|The BoeingCompany (NYSE: BA) workers represented by the International Association of Machinists in Washington State have overwhelmingly voted to reject a contract that Boeing representatives called essential in keeping production of the company's largest passenger jet in the Puget Sound. The proposal was for a contract covering 2016-2024, and would have seen Boeing commit to keeping 777 production and manufacturing jobs local in exchange for employees giving up guaranteed pensions. The machinists' union, which went on strike in 2008, rejected the deal by 67%, leaving the future of 777 production, and Boeing's presence in Washington, in doubt.|The 777 has been built in Everett, Wash., since the planes' creation, but Boeing has been shopping locations to produce the newest redesign, the 777X. The company has suggested Texas, California, and South Carolina, where Boeing already has a 787 Dreamliner assembly line in Charleston, as possible alternatives to Washington. The wings, which along with the engines are the most important part of the redesign, could be constructed in Japan, where carbon composite wings for the 787 were assembled. Building the 777X, or even a major part of it, would mean tens of thousands of jobs for the region that wins production of the plane.|Boeing claimed that keeping production in the Puget Sound area would require a generous tax package from the state, which it received, and swift passage of a contract with the union. Boeing used a carrot and stick approach to get the union to sign on, with the carrot being a $10,000 signing bonus for each employee and the stick being the implicit threat that it would begin moving jobs out of state if the union didn't vote on and approve the contract right away. Part of Boeing's interest in pushing the issue now may be that the machinists are still under an existing contract, meaning they cannot legally go on strike until 2016. That weakens the unions' hand at the negotiating table, yet the union is clearly willing to call Boeing's bluff.|To be sure, Washington is not out of consideration for the 777X, and there's a lot recommending the region. Not only has the state government passed nearly $9 billion in tax breaks for Boeing, the largest state-level subsidy in history, but the company's recent experience with outsourcing production has been rocky. The 787 Dreamliner was over three years late for a variety of reasons, but a major one was the difficulty Boeing had in integrating subassemblies built all over the world, from Italy to Japan. And Boeing's 787 manufacturing facility in South Carolina, the company's only major assembly site outside of Washington, has failed to meet projected production rates for the Dreamliner, requiring the Washington production lines to pick up the slack.|All this means that while the machinists' union vote means that building the 777X in Washington is no longer a sure thing, the workers might just have been right to hold out for a better deal. It may well be cheaper for Boeing to offer a sweeter contract to its Washington employees than to risk production delays by outsourcing the 777X to less experienced facilities. It is important for Boeing to get away from the antiquated defined benefit pension program and shift employees onto defined contribution programs like 401(k)s, but Boeing needs to get its most qualified and veteran workforce on board with this change. The 777X may be the company's best-selling jet ever, with its initial launch already expected to be worth nearly $90 billion. The two sides still have a couple years to come to an agreement, and with the incredible market opportunity ahead for the 777X, there should be plenty of room for Boeing's management and employees to come to an equitable arrangement.|Like Boeing for the dividends?Regardless of what happens over the next few months with Boeing's contract dispute, its healthy and growing dividend cushions its investors against any shots.

At least not for a few years and here's why. 1) They are still under contract until 2016. 2) S. Carolina is not properly set up. There first roll-out was actually a plane that was flown in from Everett's plant, so goes the rumor in the grapevine. 3) S. Carolina can't build a complete plane on their own. Planes had to brought up here to Everett to get finished because S. Carolina couldn't meet the demands. They are rolling out a partial plane every other month while Everett is rolling out 12 per year. 4) Rumor is S. Carolina doesn't have FAA cert for the planes they can produce which is partially why they are brought up here to Everett. Based on those 4 factors, my neighbors don't see Boeing going anywhere and any attempt to do so would be disastrous for them.|Boeing will leave Washington. That is a certainty. The South will welcome a good employer and Seattle will become the next Detroit. Organized labor will screw a million people with the help of Democrats.|Detroit was destroyed by Democrats and the UAW. Will Seattle be completely destroyed by the Machinists Union? I suspect not. Seattle still has other employers and the loss of Boeing will not destroy the city. Democrats and Organized Labor, on the other hand, will be treated like vermin. The IAM just screwed their membership into poverty and the leadership of the IAM is now rich while their members are poor. Maybe union members will remember this and treat their leaders to a free lunch on a boat that sinks in the Seattle Harbor!

"There are options for us to look at and we will evaluate them and decide."|The message is clear: Boeing will either get the deal it wants with the machinists, or something relatively close, or it will build the 777X somewhere else.|The comments from some of the 31,000 machinists who voted down a new labor contract make it clear they are angry with the offer from Boeing. One major factor they are upset about is a proposed change to their pension plan from a defined-benefit program guaranteeing a certain amount every month in retirement to a defined-contribution plan which would work more like a 401(k).|But what really irks the rank and file is Boeing threatening to move 777X production outside of the Seattle area.

The tax incentive package the state of Washington approved for Boeing to build the 777X in the Puget Sound was a whopper of a deal.|Lawmakers in Washington passed it because the new plane guarantees relatively high-paying manufacturing jobs. Other cities and states will want those jobs and will match or exceed the tax incentives offered to Boeing in Washington.|More importantly, if Boeing sets up 777X manufacturing in a right-to-work state where it doesn't have to deal with unions, investors will be thrilled.|But from the viewpoint of investors, Boeing will likely get what it wants either in Seattle or elsewhere.

Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Boeing (NYSE: BA) are both posting reasonable gains this morning. Home Depot climbed 1.5% in reaction to initial comments from Federal Reserve chair nominee Janet Yellen supporting the increasingly common view that interest rates could stay low through 2017. With the home improvement retailer having benefited greatly from rising home prices that in turn depended on easy financing, news of sustained low rates could extend Home Depot's rally even further.|Meanwhile, Boeing climbed 1% despite facing further labor tension as its Seattle-based machinists and aerospace workers union rejected a proposed extension of its contract with the aircraft maker. By a 2-to-1 margin, Boeing workers rejected the eight-year extension offer, with union representatives pointing specifically to preserving defined-benefit pensions as a key element of the "no" vote. Even with the dispute ongoing, Boeing still sees great promise both for its coming 777X production line and for other aircraft models that have seen strong demand.|The real answer to why the Dow isn't crashing lies in Cisco's relative lack of significance in calculating the average. With a share price of just $21, Cisco carries only about a 1% weighting in the price-weighted Dow, meaning even double-digit percentage drops have only a minimal impact. The nearly $3-per-share plunge in Cisco's stock only equates to about 20 points of downward pressure on the Dow, showing how little of the index's everyday movements depend on Cisco and other low-priced stocks. By contrast, Boeing's $134 share price gives it more than six times the influence on the Dow, giving even a relatively small percentage move a lot more weight.

Cisco shares tumbled 11 percent on Thursday, a day after it warned that revenue would drop 10 percent this quarter, and continue to contract through the middle of next year, in part due to a backlash in China against revelations about U.S. government surveillance programs. "All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned," said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who is an expert on China and technology. "But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it." Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington's refusal to buy goods from China's Huawei Technologies Co, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military.|The Snowden revelations provoked a storm in the Chinese media and added urgency to Beijing's efforts to use its market power to create indigenous software and hardware, analysts and businessmen say. "The U.S. government isn't doing any favours for Cisco," said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face "challenging political dynamics" in China. IBM last month reported a 22 percent drop in China revenue, leading to a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge attributed the company's problems to the "process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan," which caused delays in purchases. Microsoft executives singled out China as the company's weakest performing area in the world during the September quarter in an Oct. 24 earnings call. "The macro conditions in China, which I think are consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging," said Chris Suh, Microsoft's general manager for investor relations. Company officials could not be reached for comment.|BEIJING'S PRIORITIES In August, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning body, published a statement setting cyber-security standards for financial institutions, cloud computing and big data, information system secrecy management and industrial controls. Four domestic software and hardware makers, including China National Software & Service Co, announced this month they have received a "top-tier" rating from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China National Software's share price has gained nearly 250 percent since the Snowden revelations. "We hope and demand that relevant foreign companies respect China's laws," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday, when asked about Cisco's woes. "At the same time, as the Chinese government we of course have an obligation, a responsibility, to protect the country's security." Snowden's revelations have reverberated in other big emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and India. Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni said China was where the company was most affected by a political backlash, but noted that it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was due to politics versus macroeconomic trends. To be sure, the impact of any Snowden scandal backlash is unlikely to hit all U.S. tech firms equally. Cisco is perhaps most vulnerable, experts said, because it competes with two well-established Chinese telecommunications equipment providers: Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies are less competitive in producing semiconductors and database software, which means that any fallout from the scandal will have less impact on U.S. firms in those areas. "Everyone is feeling the heat from the NSA revelations," said a former employee at a major multinational technology firm. The important point, however, was that companies like IBM don't have competitors for their high-end equipment, the expert added. "If they don't buy from IBM they can't buy from anyone else."|SINGAPORE, Nov 14- U.S. technology companies including Cisco Systems Inc, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp may face new challenges selling their goods and services in China as fallout from the U.S. spying scandal starts to take a toll.

As has been the trend among technology companies lately, Cisco did a good job of beating expectations for the quarter that ended in October, with earnings per share coming in $0.02 above projections. But the company's guidance for the January quarter and for the full 2014 fiscal year were a big departure from what investors had hoped to see, with current-quarter earnings projections more than 10% below predictions.

But within the Dow, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is down more than 12%, as the networking giant reported earnings last night and issued troubling future guidance. With such a big drop, why isn't the Dow reacting more negatively?|For starters, some stocks are rising to offset Cisco's losses. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Boeing (NYSE: BA) are both posting reasonable gains this morning. Home Depot climbed 1.5% in reaction to initial comments from Federal Reserve chair nominee Janet Yellen supporting the increasingly common view that interest rates could stay low through 2017. With the home improvement retailer having benefited greatly from rising home prices that in turn depended on easy financing, news of sustained low rates could extend Home Depot's rally even further.|The real answer to why the Dow isn't crashing lies in Cisco's relative lack of significance in calculating the average. With a share price of just $21, Cisco carries only about a 1% weighting in the price-weighted Dow, meaning even double-digit percentage drops have only a minimal impact. The nearly $3-per-share plunge in Cisco's stock only equates to about 20 points of downward pressure on the Dow, showing how little of the index's everyday movements depend on Cisco and other low-priced stocks. By contrast, Boeing's $134 share price gives it more than six times the influence on the Dow, giving even a relatively small percentage move a lot more weight.

Big gains in the stock's price over the past few months point to a possible turnaround for the company, but the question Brocade has to answer is whether it can stand up to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) at a time when both Cisco and Juniper have seen challenges to their own businesses.|Brocade Communications finds itself in one of the highest-demand areas of technology right now, as the big-data initiative has driven enterprise customers' appetites to bolster their cloud presence with storage solutions to help them gather and analyze more information. Yet Cisco and Juniper have seen new challenges in their core networking businesses, and both companies have pushed their way into storage-area networking as a potential growth catalyst. Can Brocade fend off greater competition and restore its past growth rates? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Brocade Communications over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Still, Brocade will have to deal with Cisco and Juniper. Cisco's earnings results last night showed the conundrum that the networking giant is in, as it foresees further sluggishness from emerging-market economies that have suffered slowdowns in recent years. Meanwhile, both Cisco and Juniper have felt the impact of the U.S. federal government shutdown to some extent. Because of their relatively weakness lately, both Juniper and Cisco will undoubtedly push harder to shore up their competitive positions in the industry.|But Brocade is responding with technological innovations of its own. Earlier this month, Brocade presented a proposal to extend the Neutron OpenStack networking framework, with its Dynamic Network Resource Manager proposal presenting an option that enterprises can use to create cloud-computing environments that they can customize more easily to their specific needs. By embracing open standards, Brocade hopes to address what it calls "Cisco campus lock-in," giving enterprises more flexibility to come up with unique solutions to their own challenges. Juniper has also jumped on this bandwagon, embracing an open-source solution for its OpenContrail software-defined networking controller, but Brocade hopes it can make a stronger impression with various partnerships designed to emphasize its independence.|In the Brocade earnings report, watch to see whether the company can sustain its cost-cutting success while also finding opportunities for revenue growth. With many companies reporting weak sales, Brocade could rise sharply if it can buck the trend and find more opportunities to take business from Cisco and Juniper while they're down.

As my colleague John Divine noted earlier today, it's never good to have a recall, but for a company going through a turnaround, it's coming at a particularly horrible time -- just a few weeks before Thanksgiving and the kickoff to the holiday shopping season.|As for Cisco, the decline came as the result of a poor earnings report and a lower-than-expected forecast moving forward. Although the company posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.53, and analysts were only expecting $0.51 per share, revenue only grew 2%, while Wall Street wanted to see 3% to 5% growth in sales. Furthermore, management expects revenue in the coming quarter to fall 8% to 10% from the $12.09 billion in sales the company reported during its second quarter last year.|As for Cisco, if we look at what the revenue decline of 8% to 10% in the next quarter will mean for the company, the fact that Cisco lost $14 billion in market cap after this news is insane. Even if revenue declines the full 10%, as the company said it could in the coming months, it only equates to a revenue decline of just more than $1.2 billion. While a 10% drop in sales is dramatic, Cisco's stock hasn't been one that was priced for perfection lately -- It currently trades at just 11.5 times past earnings, and about 9.5 time's forward earnings. The company has over $48 billion in cash, it pays a 2.9% dividend, and has a $16 billion share buyback program in place, which could reduce the outstanding shares by around 10%.|Cisco's decline today was even more overblown than Hewlett-Packard's, and should be seen as a great buying opportunity for investors looking to own a quality blue chip company for years to come.

Unlike Cisco and HP, no substantive developments sent the stock lower Thursday. Xilinx is 50% more volatile than the overall stock market, so when tech mainstays like Cisco convey a fundamental weakness in the business, investors are prone to extrapolate, and punish this smaller tech player. It doesn't help that a number of Wall Street analysts have only modest hopes for Xilinx's stock price; Piper Jaffray reiterated its neutral rating on shares yesterday, giving the stock a price target with a mere 9% upside to Tuesday's close.

The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and attractive valuation levels. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.

Cisco had expected an increase of 3% to 5% for the quarter. Low orders from emerging markets and slow sales to service providers were part of the company's problems this quarter. The former fell by 21%, while video-related equipment sales to service providers declined by 14%.|Cisco Chairman and CEO John Chambers said the company's slow revenue growth in the quarter was below its expectations. In the analyst call, Chambers said, "Over the last few quarters, I've shared with you what I've been seeing; a macro environment that is inconsistent and very hard to read, with business leaders' confidence slowing purchase decisions."|By company segments, Cisco's enterprise division grew by 2%, commercial rose by 1%, public sector declined by 1% and service providers declined by 13%. Chambers also noted that the government shut down hurt the company's business by about $50 million.|The slow quarter caused Cisco's profit to decline by 4.6% to $2 billion, with earnings per share of $0.37, down from $0.39 a year ago.

"But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it."|Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington's refusal to buy goods from China's Huawei Technologies, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military.|"The U.S. government isn't doing any favours for Cisco," said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face "challenging political dynamics" in China.|Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni said China was where the company was most affected by a political backlash, but noted that it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was due to politics versus macroeconomic trends. To be sure, the impact of any Snowden scandal backlash is unlikely to hit all U.S. tech firms equally.|Cisco is perhaps most vulnerable, experts said, because it competes with two well-established Chinese telecommunications equipment providers: Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies are less competitive in producing semiconductors and database software, which means that any fallout from the scandal will have less impact on U.S. firms in those areas.

In 2012, it laid off 1,300 people. In 2011, it let go a whopping 6,500 employees.|Here's yet another element that should lead to questioning whether such situations add up to management failure and serious, yet basic, problems. This year, Cisco has hired 7,500 people.|On the one hand, Cisco hasn't taken too many jobs out of the already struggling economy. On the other, if management is hiring and firing, rinsing and repeating, is it hiring properly to begin with? In the social sense, that is actually messing with people's actual lives, as well. It also ruins morale with existing workers.|Based upon my working in private industry for over 30 years and also talking to people who work at Cisco and GE (yes, I'm using real data here) there is no "bell curve" or numerical ratings. People get hired and fired based on "human" perceptions of their performance. Managers know the "good" and "bad" workers.|Regarding Cisco firing 6,500 people and hiring 7,500 people. If the company is like most these days it probably needed to let go production workers (and hire engineers or other high tech workers) because of advances in technology that made manufacturing more efficient. It probably was not due to the fact that Cisco management hired the wrong people and had to let them go.|At the same time, organizations have to be able to re-direct employees to higher purposes and different organizations. . when things just aren't working out. I suspect you'll agree with this -- how would you feel if you knew Cisco gave 2 years severance pay to all 6500 employees. . . all of whom had agreed to accept the offer. . . and to seek a better challenge in life?

Cisco shares tumbled 11 percent on Thursday, a day after it warned that revenue would drop 10 percent this quarter, and continue to contract through the middle of next year, in part due to a backlash in China against revelations about U.S. government surveillance programs. "All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned," said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who is an expert on China and technology. "But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it." Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington's refusal to buy goods from China's Huawei Technologies Co, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military.|The Snowden revelations provoked a storm in the Chinese media and added urgency to Beijing's efforts to use its market power to create indigenous software and hardware, analysts and businessmen say. "The U.S. government isn't doing any favours for Cisco," said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face "challenging political dynamics" in China. IBM last month reported a 22 percent drop in China revenue, leading to a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge attributed the company's problems to the "process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan," which caused delays in purchases. Microsoft executives singled out China as the company's weakest performing area in the world during the September quarter in an Oct. 24 earnings call. "The macro conditions in China, which I think are consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging," said Chris Suh, Microsoft's general manager for investor relations. Company officials could not be reached for comment.|SINGAPORE, Nov 14- U.S. technology companies including Cisco Systems Inc, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp may face new challenges selling their goods and services in China as fallout from the U.S. spying scandal starts to take a toll.

It is the David to giants like Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) .|Nike and Adidas both dwarf Under Armour with sales of $26 billion and $19 billion, respectively. Under Armour's $2.2 billion runs a distant third to the two giants in shoes and sportswear. However, if CEO Kevin Plank has his way the race has only just begun. He passionately believes that Under Armour has the speed and endurance to catch the competition.|Long may you runUnder Armour began in a basement making lightweight compression undershirts that wicked moisture away rather than absorbing it, making workouts drier and lighter. The company has traveled lightyears from its humble beginnings and now makes a complete line of athletic wear, and most recently running shoes and cleats. Shoes have been the most difficult puzzle to solve, and its a market in which both Nike and Adidas continue to dominate.|Nike is the big dog in shoes, with 57% of its revenue coming from footwear sales and only 27% from apparel. Adidas sees more balanced between segments, with 46% of sales in shoes and 42% in apparel. Under Armour has yet to make footwear a killer segment, and it's only 13% of revenue--apparel sales are 76%.|Nike sold an impressive $14.5 billion in athletic shoes in 2012 and Adidas came in at $9.5 billion which both overshadowed Under Armour's $239 million. Under Armour remains undeterred and the changes and innovations keep coming as the company tweaks the shoes to get runners to try them. Sales are increasing.|Under Armour's hare to Nike's tortoiseUnder Armour's growth has been more dazzling than Usain Bolt's record 9.58 second 100m dash. If Plank can continue his charismatic pushing of Under Armour product into new market segments, growth for the company may be in its first of many laps. Plank is dynamic and driven, and he is positioning Under Armour for long and profitable growth.|Meanwhile Nike's appeal is not in high growth bursts, but in measured sustainable and predictable performance year after year. Nike's compound annual growth rate has been 9.9% since 1994. Under Armour's run has been spectacular. It looks like Kevin Plank has every intention of keeping it there with expansion into the international market and perfecting the athletic shoe.|By nearly every ratio, Under Armour is far pricier than Nike or Adidas. You can argue that it deserves the valuation because its growth is high and its opportunities for expansion seem almost limitless at present. Guidance for 2013 was raised to $2.26 billion, a 23% increase over 2012, with operating income expected to grow by 25%. While there should be enough growth to send Under Armour higher, if it simply meets guidance or fails to reach these numbers investors may find a chink in its armor that provides a buying opportunity.

According to a report from Transparency Market Research, this market is expected to grow by around 46.6% in the period of 2011-2017 to reach $52.2 billion, driven by increasing birth rates and rising hygiene awareness in developing economies. Big global players like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) , Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) , and Kao Corporation (NASDAQOTH: KCRPY) will certainly benefit from this favorable trend.|Procter & Gamble with its Pampers brandProcter & Gamble has the market-leading position in baby care, including diapers and baby wipes, with around 35% of the global market share. Pampers, the company's biggest brand, is the main driver for its baby-care business around the world. Pampers alone generates more than $10 billion in sales and accounts for around 12% of the company's total revenue.|Kao's international business expansionKao Corporation, the second-largest diaper player in Japan, owns around 30% of the total Japanese market. With its presence in Japan it has an advantage over Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark in penetrating the Asian emerging markets.|My Foolish takeThe battle between Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark will be fierce in the diaper business, especially in the emerging markets. In Asia in general and in China in particular, Kao has emerged as the rising player in the global diaper market. However, Kao is the most expensively valued among the three at around 20.6 times its forward earnings valuation, while the forward P/E ratios of Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark are lower at around 17.7. With dividend yields of 3%, both Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark can be considered long-term income investment opportunities for income investors.

While Kimberly-Clark has experienced a 31.40% increase in the market since November of last year, the gains of Procter & Gamble and Unilever were only 20.14% and 6.43%, respectively. Should investors consider Kimberly-Clark a good investment opportunity now? Let's dive in and find out|Procter & Gamble's huge savings programThe leading position in the global diaper market belongs to Procter & Gamble with its Pampers brand. This brand is considered the largest of the company, and also the No. 1 diaper brand in the world. Procter & Gamble also relies on a cost savings program to drive its future profitability. The company is implementing its $10 billion cost reduction plan, including $2 billion in operating leverage, $6 billion in cost of goods sold, and another $2 billion in overhead savings and market efficiencies. A part of the savings program will comprise support staff reductions in emerging markets and factory shutdowns in developed markets.|Which stock should you choose?With its leading market position, product innovation, and strong growth in international markets, Kimberly-Clark could deliver good returns and dividends to shareholders in the long run. Income investors might choose Unilever for its yield. Among the three, I prefer Procter & Gamble because it has the lowest payout ratio and a reasonable dividend yield. Furthermore, its $10 billion cost savings plan could certainly drive its operating margin higher, thus improving its earnings substantially in the next three years.

Wal-Mart earnings were a bit cheapIt's too bad that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) couldn't buy a better version of its earnings report at one of its megastores. Wal-Mart announced Thursday that sales in the U.S. fell for the third straight quarter.

If Wal-Mart really wants to expand more, they might want to cut this top seller.

To this regard, I would like to use telecom powerhouse AT&T(T) as an example.|Based in Dallas, AT&T has nearly a quarter of a million employees who provide telecom service to virtually every country in the world. The AT&T name traces its roots all the way back to the beginning with Alexander Graham Bell and the invention of the telephone. However, the legacy company itself was forced to break up in 1984 through an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. From this arrangement, SBC Communications was formed along with a variety of smaller telephone companies. SBC began aggressively acquiring communication providers in the late 1990s, and in 2005 acquired AT&T Corp., shedding the SBC name in lieu of the iconic AT&T. This created the new AT&T and continues the storied history.|In viewing the past operating history of AT&T, it is prudent to view the company from the time of the SBC acquisition moving forward. Below I have included an Earnings and Price Correlated F.A.S.T. Graph for AT&T dating to 2006. Here we see that operating earnings (orange line) have been growing at just over 9% a year for the last eight years, while price has generally followed earnings. In addition, it's useful to recognize that the dividend (pink line) has been steadily increasing over this time period. Note that the payout ratio grew to over 100% recently due in large part to charges related to the failed T-Mobile acquisition.

As airlines strive to balance passenger comfort and cost efficiency, B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ: BEAV) , the world's largest maker of aircraft cabin interior products for commercial airliners, could benefit most from this ongoing debate, having landed a few big recent deals with airlines and jet manufacturers alike.|In January 2012, B/E Aerospace was named as the exclusive manufacturer of modular lavatory systems for Boeing's 737 Next-Generation family of airplanes. It literally "stole" this $800 million Boeing deal from under the nose of Zodiac Aerospace, the leader in aircraft lavatories with about 75% global market share.|This deal is part of B/E Aerospace's new supplier-furnished equipment (SFE) business, in which it sells aircraft interiors directly to aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, as opposed to its tradition of supplying these products to airlines. On the back of the first lavatory retrofit project Boeing awarded in April 2013, B/E Aerospace is optimistic about further contract wins from Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers. It has guided for SFE revenues to almost triple from $150 million in 2012 to $400 million in 2015.|ConclusionIn a competitive market, airlines are increasingly trying to get ahead by cutting costs while offering standout services. In light of this, the current seat width debate should be viewed in the broader context of airlines' efforts to maximize their profits on every flight. No matter how much Boeing and Airbus may squabble, I am optimistic that B/E Aerospace's innovative products will enable it to win more orders from airlines.

They'll be voting up or down on a proposed eight-year extension of their contract with the airplane manufacturer.|Like its new 787-9 Dreamliner, Boeing stock could be poised to take off. Source: Boeing|If they approve the contract, Boeing will almost certainly choose to reward them by agreeing to build its new 777X airliner in Washington state -- especially given that the state just offered the company $9 billion in tax breaks if it does decide to build the plane locally.

But for shareholders, the key point is that this is also a good deal for Boeing.|Turnabout really is fair playToday's vote comes five years after a hard-fought contract in which IAM basically threatened to bleed Boeing dry unless it caved -- postponing production of the new 787 Dreamliner and denying Boeing the cash flow it needed to live. By some estimates, that dispute cost Boeing $5.2 billion, and perhaps $535 million in profits, in revenue lost or postponed. But with 787 sales in full swing, and Boeing's backlog robust, the company's in fine financial fettle today -- and positioned for a win.|Today's vote gives Boeing a chance to make its union happy and to keep it that way for years, with no risk from further IAM strikes for nearly a decade. The shift from defined benefit pension programs to defined contributions and the de minimus pay raise guarantees (only 1% every two years!) further promise to boost the company's profits, and should make planning for the future a snap.|If all goes as planned in today's vote, it should be pretty easy for investors to decide to buy Boeing, too.|Like security?

It's an inevitability of the industry, of course, since the financial fortunes of energy giants depend on how much energy they can locate and process. At the same time, investors are putting pressure on companies like Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to trim their spending plans and instead return more cash to shareholders. Do Chevron investors have a reasonable gripe against their company for spending too much? Or is the ongoing debate much ado about nothing?|Chevron hits the throttle on 2014 spendingChevron recently advised analysts its 2014 capital expenditure budget would likely be between $33 billion and $36 billion, which rubbed some investors the wrong way. Chevron's 2013 spending is already on pace to eclipse the $33 billion projected earlier this year, due to significant land acquisitions. And, when Raymond James analysts pressed management if Chevron's $36 billion likely to be spent this year represents a ceiling going forward, Chief Executive Officer John Watson couldn't give a hard guarantee of that. Meanwhile, some of Chevron's peers have different plans.|Like Chevron, Total makes no apologies for its ambitious spending plans.

Indeed, Total has a dividend greater than 4%, so it's probably right in that regard.|In the end, not a reason to panicInvestors often squabble about the spending priorities of Big Oil, and to a certain degree, it's a reasonable argument. Many institutional investors are clamoring for higher cash returns instead of deploying billions on questionable projects that may or may not pan out. In the case of Chevron, however, I'd advise investors to be patient. Chevron is an extremely well-run energy major that has produced spectacular returns over many years, and it's not as if shareholders are being treated poorly. Chevron still provides a 3.3% dividend yield that beats the yield on the broader market.|At this point, Chevron investors have little choice but to allow management to do what they do best. Chevron is confident its investments will pay off, and only time will tell if its projections prove accurate. In the meantime, for investors not willing to wait it out, higher-yielding alternatives including BP and Total could be better choices for investors who consider income to be their primary concern.

Last quarter, the company posted solid revenue and earnings growth, but a combination of weak guidance and planned layoffs spooked investors. The stock sunk on the news, and today it still sits well below the pre-earnings level.|The biggest threatCisco has a dominant share in its core switching market, and its proprietary hardware allows the company to achieve impressive margins. Network switches form the backbone of the Internet, receiving data and sending it to the correct destination. But a shift toward software-defined networking, or SDN, threatens Cisco's outsized profits.|SDN essentially allows software to manage the flow of data, and this means that commodity hardware can be used instead of proprietary hardware. This is bad news for Cisco, since its profitability depends on selling its specialized hardware. Shifting to an SDN solution would, according to this report, cut Cisco's revenue in half.|Competitors keen on taking some of Cisco's market share are launching SDN products of their own. Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) recently launched OpenContrail, an open-source SDN controller. A commercial version is also available, with Juniper charging a subscription fee for support.|With Juniper having a tiny switch market share compared to Cisco, the open-source strategy may make sense. After being unable to effectively compete with Cisco in hardware, jumping on the SDN bandwagon is likely the best move for the company.|Instead of pushing SDN and eschewing hardware, Cisco has adopted a hybrid approach. On Nov. 6, Cisco launched its Insieme line of products, a set of switches, software, and APIs which offer an alternative to other SDN products. These switches can dynamically adapt to an application's needs, and the APIs provide a high level of programmability.|Cisco is betting that its huge install base will stick with the company's products instead of switching to a different platform, and that its margins will be protected in the process.|While Insieme won't show up on the upcoming earnings report, next quarter's report should provide details on how the new product is performing. The company may discuss Insieme in its conference call, and investors should definitely tune in to get a sense of Cisco's strategy going forward.|New marketsCisco has been trying to diversify beyond its core markets, and recent acquisitions and investments are driving that effort forward. Cisco recently invested in an unnamed start-up with the aim of pushing into the mobile base station market, and in September Cisco bought solid-state memory company Whiptail. These come a few months after Cisco announced the acquisition of Sourcefire, a leader in cybersecurity solutions.|Non-core businesses have been growing quickly at Cisco, but they still make up a minority of revenue and profits. The push into cybersecurity is particularly notable, as recent cases of large-scale hacking of governments and corporations have made clear the need for more security. Cisco is positioning itself to take advantage of this trend, and its size and resources should give it an edge against competitors like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW) .|Palo Alto is tiny compared to Cisco, with annual revenue of about $400 million. With estimates that the IT security industry will grow tenfold in the next decade, revenue should continue to grow at an impressive pace. Palo Alto still hasn't found consistent profitability, though, with the company losing $29 million in the fiscal year that ended in July.|It's difficult to tell which company will become the leader in the cybersecurity industry, but Cisco has the benefit of highly profitable businesses which can fund growth, both organically and through more acquisitions.|Cisco is a slow-growing company, and any kind of beat or miss will likely be small. Quarter-to-quarter results don't matter very much for a company of Cisco's size, with the long-term trends proving to be far more important. The conference call is what investors will be watching, as CEO John Chambers talks about the state of the company and the world economy as a whole.|The bottom lineThe numbers aren't as important as the commentary from management when Cisco reports earnings on Wednesday. Guidance for next quarter -- as well as trends in the industry -- should provide more meaningful information for investors than the financial results themselves. I encourage all investors to listen to the conference call, or read a transcript, and look beyond the numbers.

In addition to specific proprietary factors, Trade-Ideas identified Cisco Systems as such a stock due to the following factors:|Cisco Systems, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells Internet protocol (IP) and other products related to the communications and information technology industry worldwide. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.9%. CSCO has a PE ratio of 12.6. Currently there are 22 analysts that rate Cisco Systems a buy, no analysts rate it a sell, and 6 rate it a hold.|The average volume for Cisco Systems has been 35.3 million shares per day over the past 30 days.

The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and attractive valuation levels. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/12106473/1/exxon-mobils-back-to-growth.html|11/13/2013|0|"Exxon Mobil"|0|Exxon Mobil's Back to Growth|NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- I don't want to nitpick, but you have to work extremely hard to find any disparaging points about Exxon Mobil's(XOM) business, especially when the company is second only to Apple(AAPL) in the race to be the largest company in the world according to market cap.|As much in love as I have been with Chevron(CVX), Exxon has no rival when assessing its ability to convert oil and gas into cash flow and dividends. Not to mention, its impressive history of returns on capital. But the company has been far from flawless.|Lately, Exxon has been dealing with some operational deficiencies, which have worried investors. Not only has management dealt with rising costs, but also energy projects -- which have in the past generated strong returns -- have underperformed. And weak production growth, particularly in North America, has threatened the company's long-term status as an energy power.|On the heels of a weak third-quarter report from rival Royal Dutch Shell(RDS-B), Exxon investors were chewing their nails in anticipation of the numbers the company was going to produce. But Exxon didn't disappoint. The company posted a profit of $7.87 billion, or $1.79 per share, which beat Street estimates by 2 cents. This is despite a slight increase in costs and a 2.4% drop in revenue.|There was some uneasiness about Exxon's revenue decline, which has been a struggle over the past several quarters. But unlike, say, the tech or financial sectors, revenue growth is not as important in the energy sector. The ability to replenish worldwide oil and gas consumption, which is known as "production," is what drives Exxon's earnings. While the company has done relatively well amid what remains a weak oil-priced environment, this quarter's turnaround shouldn't be understated.|What's more, given that Exxon's year-over-year liquid production advanced more than 5%, it's fair to say that the company is now back to production growth. Plus, that the chemical business grew earnings by 30% means that even though the company's expenses are on the rise (15% increase this quarter), management is using capital in ways that benefit shareholders. As I've said on more than one occasion, growth is not free.|To that end, given the uncertainty that still remains regarding oil prices, Exxon's main challenge will continue to be production and exploration. I don't see any other way to address the recent decline in the company's refining unit. Not to mention, the continued struggle in the downstream business due to (among other things) weak margins. Management will need to find untapped oil resources, which also means an increase in production projects.|Exxon isn't lacking in cash to fund growth. The question, though, is how much of the company's existing capital is management willing to risk, given that recent returns on projects have underperformed? There's been an environment of "throwing good money after bad." But I believe the greater risk lies in doing absolutely nothing.|Despite the soft revenue and year-over-year decline in profits, Exxon has not lost its leadership role in the energy sector. While the stock is not going to excite investors with strong upswings, those who value safety can still do well here. Not to mention, Exxon is one of the best dividend payers in any sector at 2.8%. There's no question that Exxon has seen better days. But with the slight uptick this quarter in production growth, I believe the worst is over.
http://www.thestreet.com/story/12106474/1/bp-looks-like-a-relative-bargain.html|11/13/2013|0|"Exxon Mobil"|1|This was -- without a doubt -- a disaster. But I don't believe it warranted the death sentence that many BP opponents demanded. It seems unfair to vilify BP and not Exxon Mobil(XOM), whose oil tanker, Exxon Valdez, spilled 11 million gallons of crude in Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989. Besides, it wasn't as if BP employees intentionally laced the rig with dynamite that caused the explosion and the subsequent spill.|And while these shares have rebounded from that horrific event, including gains of 17% year to date, BP stock is still down more than 20% since May 2010. Even with the 15% gains the stock has enjoyed over the past two months, BP shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio that is half that of both Exxon and ConocoPhillips(COP). Not to mention, the valuation is 3 points lower than Chevron(CVX).|Despite ongoing production weakness that has also impacted Exxon and Chevron, BP posted third-quarter profit of $3.7 billion, beating Street estimates of $3.4 billion. BP's oil production fell 2% year over year. Although this was slightly below Chevron and Exxon, which posted growth of 1.5% and 3%, respectively, BP's output was consistent with that of Royal Dutch Shell(RDS-A).

But because Goldman is now only selecting new managing directors every other year, this might mean that Goldman will now be naming new managing directors at a slower rate over the long term. The implication for Goldman's workforce will not be fully known until we see whether a larger class is named in 2015.|"We wish our new Managing Directors continued success and thank them for their dedication and hard work representing the firm and our clients," said Lloyd C.

Traditionally, Goldman selected managing directors every year and named a small slice of those to be partners every other year. In a memo earlier this year, Goldman said it would select managing directors every other year. This means that new directors and new partners will be named on alternate years.|Goldman has about 2,000 managing directors, some 6.3 percent of its workforce.The number of managing directors named this year is expected to be in line with past years. If this pattern holds, it will mean that Goldman will end up naming far fewer managing directors in the future than it has in the past. So the result of the decision to go biennial is likely to be a decline in the number of managing directors named over a five-year period.|Goldman's promotion decisions can be looked at as a barometer of Wall Street. The firm says it promotes based on market conditions and quality of the talent pool. A large number of promotions can mean that Goldman expects a near-term pickup in money-making opportunities. A particularly small number indicates a contraction.|This year's number suggests that Goldman basically expects things to trudge along as they have in the recent past.|Wednesday's announcement follows a general trend that has emerged at Goldman over the last several years. It is one part belt-tightening, which is in vogue all over the banking sector as firms trim expenses by cutting compensation costs. It also is likely to have the effect of making Goldman's workforce younger, as the firm has lately been hiring many more summer interns and junior analysts, making it more likely that some vice presidents will leave after being passed over this year.

This is fairly common when a stock has risen as far and as fast as Under Armour has (about 60% since the beginning of 2013), as it seems that almost too much good news is priced into the shares. However, I believe that the recent dip in Under Armour is setting up a terrific buying opportunity in a company that could conceivably overtake Nike (NYSE: NKE) within the next decade as the athletic apparel leader.|The quarterly numbersBy virtually any measure, Under Armour posted an excellent quarter. The company reported earnings of $0.68 per share on $723.1 million in revenue, handily beating estimates of $0.66 on $710 million. The company also reported excellent growth in international sales which made up $44 million of its revenue, an increase of 38% from last year but still just 6% of the company's total sales. In contrast, more than half (53%) of Nike's sales come from international markets.|Future potentialWhen examining the company's future potential, it's almost hard to imagine Under Armour not becoming the market leader eventually. Currently, Nike's sales are higher than Under Armour's sales by more than a factor of 10, with Nike projected to reach $27.5 billion in sales for the current fiscal year. However, Under Armour has a great deal of untapped revenue sources that it has yet to capitalize on.|First, there's the company's international sales growth, which I've already mentioned. While it is true that most of Under Armour's sales come from the U.S., the company is making a strong effort to change that and to increase its brand awareness all over the world. By achieving a global sales mix similar to Nike's over the next several years, Under Armour's sales could double through this alone.|It's expensive, so why not buy Nike?With the stock at almost 45 times next year's expected earnings, it appears that the market is relatively confident in Under Armour's long-term potential. Nike trades for 25.3 times next year's earnings and it is expected to grow those earnings by 14% annually for the next three years according to S&P. Under Armour is projected to grow its earnings by 21% annually during that time period, but the key difference is in the long-term sustainability of its growth potential.|With an enormous market share and excellent international penetration, Nike can only be expected to sustain high growth rates for a few years. On the other hand, Under Armour's 21% projected growth rate can be sustained almost indefinitely at this point. To put the potential in perspective, at this growth rate Under Armour would hit about $12 billion in annual sales in 10 years, which is about half of where Nike is now. This is certainly an achievable, if not conservative target. However, if Nike were to sustain its lower 14% earnings growth rate for a decade, this would put its annual sales at just under $100 billion, which is higher than the entire footwear market.

That deal was designed to bump up its own profit picture. However, the company probably won't be going on any more spending sprees until it can knock down some of the debt taken on.|VOD went to school on how Verizon became the premier American cellular network and make no mistake that is the way to play the cloud. It will now be able to upgrade their markets around the world at their discretion depending on economic conditions at any time in which ever country has the disposable income to afford the smart phones, and tablets to pay those $200 monthly fees. All without the debt that Verizon has attained. They will be Apple and Google 10 to 20 years from now. That is if ATT can't figure a way to steal the promise from VOD share holders. I still can't for the life of me understand why Verizon didn't just use that 130 billion buy VOD instead of making them a take over canidate for their competetor.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/13/how-does-wal-mart-look-compared-to-target-costco-a.aspx|11/13/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|5|How Does Wal-Mart Look Compared to Target, Costco and Best Buy?|Thursday will likely be a big day for Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) , the world's largest retailer with a market capitalization of more than $255.3 billion and 2012 sales of roughly $469.2 billion, as it reports its earnings for the third quarter of 2013. In comparison, Target (NYSE: TGT) , one of Wal-Mart's biggest competitors, has a market capitalization of $41.3 billion and 2012 sales of $73.3 billion, while Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) sits in the middle with a market capitalization of $53.5 billion and 2012 revenue of almost $105.2 billion. All three retailers will be watched closely going into the holiday season by investors for indications of how the last quarter of the year will treat these mega-retailers. Tomorrow might just be the most important day of them all.|Earnings expectationsFor the quarter, the consensus between analysts is that Wal-Mart will post earnings per share of $1.13 on revenue of $116.79 billion. If this expectation comes to fruition, then it would market a 4.6% increase in the company's earnings per share of $1.08 from the same quarter a year ago. Furthermore, it would imply that revenue for the industry behemoth has risen by 2.5% from the $113.93 billion the company reported this time last year.|How does Wal-Mart stack up against its peers?While analyzing a company's performance year-to-date is nice, it is more important to understand how the company has performed over an extended period of time, especially compared to its peers. In an attempt to assess this, I decided to pit the company up against Target and Costco.|From a revenue perspective, Wal-Mart has performed in the middle of the pack. Over the past five years, the company saw its revenue rise by 16%. In comparison, Target was only capable of increasing its revenue by 12.9%. Although both of these growth rates are acceptable, they pale in comparison to the 47.2% growth rate experienced by Costco.|Looking now toward net income, we see a similar, but slightly different story. While Costco saw its net income rise by an astonishing 87.8%, placing it in first place again, it was Target that earned second place with a growth rate of 35.5%. In contrast, Wal-Mart came in third place with a 26.9% improvement in its net income; still good but leaving investors to question if Target or, very possibly, Costco, might eventually knock Wal-Mart out of the number one spot eventually.|A new threat appearsIn addition to competition coming in from Target and Costco, Wal-Mart is also being threatened by a company that no one would have guessed a few years ago. The culprit? None other than Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) , an electronics retailer with a market capitalization of $15 billion.|Now, admittedly, the company is far smaller than Wal-Mart and its focus is in electronics while Wal-Mart focuses on... well... everything, but a new advertisement for the company recently released challenges the assertion that Wal-Mart is the true place to buy things on the cheap. In addition to cutting $200 off the purchase price of a variety of Hewlett-Packard laptops (and beating at least one model by a penny), it's giving significant discounts on Apple products, such as $1,099.99 for the regularly priced $1,299.99 MacBook Pro with retina display.|Foolish takeawayUndoubtedly, Wal-Mart is the big fish in the retail industry. However, just because of this, we cannot assume that this will always hold true. Target is catching up in terms of profitability, whereas Costco has rapidly expanded and is beating the giant on both its top line and bottom line in terms of year over year growth. Furthermore, Best Buy, though still small, should serve as a warning that size isn't everything in retail and that, in time, a smaller retailer may have ample opportunity to catch up to and steal market power from, a company as big as Wal-Mart in at least one of its segments.|As far as earnings go, I don't believe it's out of the question to expect big things from the power player that is Wal-Mart in the short term. But, investors should remain only cautiously optimistic in the company's future prospects, because it appears as though multiple competitors are beginning to close in.

This afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) down a meager 15 points as of 12:30 p.m. EST, stocks are simply taking a breather after their recent record run-up. Yet while broad-market followers look for signs of general economic strength or weakness, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) will give a key reading on the state of the retail sector when it issues its quarterly earnings report tomorrow. With so many consumer-goods companies relying on Wal-Mart for a substantial portion of their overall sales, investors should look closely at what the retail giant has to say.|Wal-Mart will release its results before the market opens tomorrow. It typically issues a press release detailing earnings results, as well as a pre-recorded phone call in which management reviews the numbers, at about 7 a.m. EST.|Wal-Mart's challenge is that it faces competition on two major fronts. Most investors have focused on the impact of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and online shopping on the big-box retail industry, and Amazon's recent quarterly results showed that it has continued to make an ever-larger impression on shoppers. With Internet commerce accounting for less than a tenth of all retail sales, Amazon has a lot more room to encroach on Wal-Mart and its fellow big-box retailers.|But many investors have played down the size of the competitive threat to Wal-Mart from other big-box retailers. Both Target (NYSE: TGT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) have made greater inroads toward finding steeper growth trajectories than Wal-Mart. For Costco, the ability to charge highly profitable membership fees has freed the warehouse retailer to slice margins to the bone on the goods it sells, giving customers a value proposition that has led to extremely high renewal rates that create a reliable stream of pure profit for the company. Meanwhile, Target has sought to make itself a more attractive and upscale destination for shoppers, incorporating margin-boosting measures like brand-name designer partnerships to woo customers and create buzz.|Even with sluggish results lately, Wal-Mart remains a key distribution outlet for many consumer-product giants, including several Dow components. The news that Wal-Mart gives investors tomorrow will likely send ripples throughout the Dow, especially if its results point to a weak holiday season that could have disastrous effects on retailers and product manufacturers throughout the industry.|Is Wal-Mart doomed?To learn more about the challenges facing the world's biggest retailer, be sure to take a look at The Motley Fool's special free report: "The Death of Wal-Mart: The Real Cash Kings Changing the Face of Retail."

The company hasn't made a big fuss out of its stance, but its doors will remain firmly closed this Thanksgiving as its employees enjoy their holiday.

On one hand, Home Depot has benefited greatly from the boom in the housing market over the past year, with loose monetary policy and direct intervention in the mortgage market having helped spur further growth for the home-improvement retailer.

Yet the Fed's policies have been instrumental in driving even reduced levels of construction and infrastructure spending.

As of 12:15 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES: ^DJI) were down about 60 points. Yet while third-quarter earnings season has largely run its course, a few stragglers are still left to report, and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) will give us the latest on its results tomorrow. Cisco is defying the Dow's drop today, rising 1.5%, and what it says could dramatically affect not just its own stock but the entire technology industry, which in turn has a dramatic impact on the Dow and the stock market more broadly.|Cisco will release its results shortly after the market closes tomorrow. The company will follow up its release with a conference call scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. EST.|Yet Cisco is one among many companies that are trying to do exactly the same thing. Fellow Dow component IBM (NYSE: IBM) has sought to ramp up its cloud, mobile, business analytics, and cybersecurity efforts in order to power profits higher, yet it has run into sluggish conditions in former growth markets that have pushed overall revenue downward. The same pressures were arguably responsible for getting Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) kicked out of the Dow, as HP wasn't as quick as IBM to reduce its reliance on hardware sales and therefore got hit harder by the crash in PC demand that accompanied the mobile revolution.|The big wildcard for Cisco will come from CEO John Chambers. In the past, even when Cisco has put up fairly strong numbers, Chambers has sometimes offered less rosy views of Cisco's future prospects, drawing criticism in some corners for his pessimism and its negative impact on the stock.|Cisco remains a vital part of the tech industry, and its reading on the tech industry's health has implications well beyond its own stock. For the Dow, a successful rebound for Cisco could point to a healthier environment for all of the Dow's tech stocks, and technology could help power the stock market to further record runs. Yet a shortfall might well have the opposite impact, especially in light of the drops that IBM and other tech giants have suffered following their lackluster results.|Find the Cisco-like growth you're looking forCisco was once the growth darling of the market, but it has given up that role.

Analysts are looking for the company to post earnings per share of $0.47 on revenue of $12.35 billion. When Cisco last reported earnings back in August, the company exceeded expectations, but shares tumbled after Cisco gave weak guidance and announced a round of layoffs.|Analysts at Goldman Sachs continue to like Cisco.

Cisco is the strongest performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) today. The company hasn't unveiled any market-moving news today, so you can chalk this jump up to investors getting excited ahead of the report.|No company is perfect, and Cisco certainly has its flaws. That being said, here are three big reasons why you might want to get in on the Cisco action right now.|The Unified Computing experiment is finally paying dividendsCisco made a huge bet on expanding its core business in 2010. No longer content to dominate the data networking sector, Cisco announced a line of server-class computing systems, designed to work in tandem with Cisco's networking gear.|Three years later, the server division is starting to pull its own weight. Cisco's Unified Computing Systems are now sold in package deals with high-end Nexus routers, and that combination is delivering a $5.5 billion annual revenue run rate nowadays. That's 11% of Cisco's total revenue stream, and sales are growing 35% annually -- way ahead of the company's overall 6% growth rate.|You could argue that Cisco is becoming the new end-to-end IT hardware provider in the IBM mold, even as IBM itself is moving on to a new software-centered strategy. And you can (finally) thank the UCS project for the good news.|The actual dividends sure help, tooCisco paid its first dividend in 2011, just before starting that crazy/awesome UCS strategy. Since then, Cisco's board has nearly tripled the annual payout per share and boosted Cisco's yield from 1.3% to 2.9%.|That's an exceptionally shareholder-friendly dividend policy -- and one you should expect to continue for a long time. Cisco has plenty of headroom for future dividend growth, even if its fundamental business stalls out for a while, as only 28% of Cisco's current free cash flow goes toward dividend checks.|Static estimates The surging UCS effort looks set to drive Cisco's results to respectable gains this quarter, but analysts haven't jumped onto that bandwagon. Average earnings estimates have actually crawled lower over the last three months. Wall Street likes to base estimates on management guidance, but Cisco CEO John Chambers is notoriously careful about setting the bar low.|If Cisco beats its own guidance again, analysts will be left flat-footed. Some may point to the next guidance aiming low -- in fact, you should expect this -- but that's just the way Chambers plays the guidance game.|Is Cisco a good investment for the long run?The best investing approach is to choose great companies and stick with them for the long term. Does Cisco fit hat bill?

In trials, those treated with 10, 15 or 20 mg/day of Somavert saw serum IGF-I levels -- a marker for growth hormone production -- normalize in 39%, 75% and 82% of patients, well above the 10% for those on placebo.

Roche (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) acquired the rights to a promising drug, Octreolin, from Chiasma earlier this year in a deal worth up to $595 million. Because Octreolin is dosed orally, Roche believes it can win significant share from Novartis and Pfizer's injectables. In phase 2 trials, Octreolin reduced growth hormone production by 80%, and the company expects results from phase 3 could come by year end. If Chiasma's drug is eventually approved, Roche's Genentech will leverage its large oncology sales force to pitch the drug in the U.S., putting significant pressure on both Novartis and Pfizer's sales force.|The Foolish final takeNovartis isn't alone in trying to reduce the risk to long standing blockbuster drugs from generics. And there is a risk Signifor won't win FDA approval for the indication prior to Sandostatin losing patent protection. But Signifor's current status as an approved drug for treating Cushing's does suggest the FDA is comfortable with the drug, and trial results seem to suggest Signifor outperforms Sandostatin, making for a compelling case. As a result, the bigger risk to Novartis may not be Signifor's approval for the indication, or Pfizer's ability to win share from Sandostatin, but instead the potential all-oral Octreolin being developed by Roche and Chiasma. That means you should pay close attention to Octreolin's upcoming phase 3 results.

Analysts make much of the company's ongoing battle with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) as the war between online and brick-and-mortar retailers wages on. But Wal-Mart has also lost some of its competitive advantages against its traditional retail rivals, with Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Target (NYSE: TGT) producing better growth through strategies aimed at distinguishing themselves from their peers.|Wal-Mart has come a long way since its terrible performance from 2009 to 2011, in which it posted nine straight quarters of falling same-store sales. Yet over the past two quarters, Wal-Mart has once again fallen into its old ways, with a 0.6% drop in overall U.S. same-store sales in the first half of the fiscal year showing the retailer's continuing growth struggles. Given the much faster pace of revenue growth at Amazon and even Costco's impressive sales gains lately, Wal-Mart needs to up its game once again. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Wal-Mart over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Stats on Wal-Mart|How can Wal-Mart fight harder?In recent months, analysts have reined in their expectations on Wal-Mart earnings, cutting October-quarter estimates by more than 3% and trimming full-year fiscal 2014 and 2015 projections by about a dime per share. The stock, though, has kept rising, picking up another 3% since early August.|Wal-Mart has long had the reputation of being the low-price leader for retail, and that has led to countercyclical financial results that might have contributed to poor performance in a rebounding economy. In its July-quarter earnings report, Wal-Mart cut its guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year, pointing to customer concerns about their jobs and the costs they face for food and energy. Even though rival Target also reported troubling results, it at least posted a solid gain in same-store sales.|There's no denying that Amazon has been a thorn in Wal-Mart's side for years. The latest example comes from Amazon's deal with the U.S. Postal Service to offer Sunday delivery, which further increases Amazon's ability to get goods to customers quickly enough to satisfy many shoppers. Wal-Mart has been offering same-day delivery of groceries and some household goods, but the arms race to ever-faster delivery options still takes away from Wal-Mart's core business of having customers actually come into its stores.|The big question facing Wal-Mart is whether it can break its countercyclical reputation. Historically, as shoppers get more money to spend, they've been more likely to spring for a membership at Costco or to pay slightly higher prices at Target to get what they perceive as a higher-quality shopping experience. Wal-Mart needs to break that cycle and woo customers beyond its traditional base to keep shopping there even if their economic fortunes improve.|In the Wal-Mart earnings report, watch to see if the company can come up with an innovative way to attract either its existing customers to shop more or a new set of potential shoppers to boost sales.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/12104477/1/one-put-one-call-option-to-know-about-for-3m-co-mmm.html|11/11/2013|0|"3M Co"|0|One Put, One Call Option To Know About For 3M Co (MMM)|Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is 3M Co (MMM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2014 expiration for MMM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $120 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 95 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.8% return against the $120 commitment, or a 4.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to MMM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless 3M Co sees its shares fall 6.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $119.05 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 95 cents from $120), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.2% annualized rate of return.|Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.2% figure actually exceeds the 2% annualized dividend paid by 3M Co by 2.2%, based on the current share price of $127.83. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 6.19% to reach the $120 strike price.

Moreover, loss reserves are improving, and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault noted, "Credit quality indicators remained at historically strong levels."|Of course, their shares have reflected this, as each stock has generated returns of more than 40%, not including dividends, over the past 52 weeks, which far outpaces the returns of the market. Yet the market reaction to each company's recent earnings results has been less than stellar. American Express increased only slightly after reporting results, while both Visa and MasterCard fell after reporting their own earnings. As a result, investors may be understandably asking: What gives?|To be fair, valuations look lofty among each of the credit card processors. MasterCard trades for 30 times trailing earnings, and American Express is the "cheapest" of the three, with a trailing multiple of 20 times earnings. These two, and Visa as well, are trading for significant premiums to both the broader market and their industry. The S&P 500 holds a trailing-12-month multiple of 19 times earnings. The financial sector is even more cheaply valued, at just 14 times trailing-12-month earnings.|Visa, MasterCard, and American Express trade for 19 times, 23 times, and 15 times, respectively. This compares with forward earnings multiples of 15 times and 12 times for the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Financial sector, respectively, based on estimated 2014 earnings.|The start of a trend?As a result, investors wondering why stocks decline after reporting great numbers should look to valuation as a possible culprit. There is a silver lining here, which is that the market has a tendency to over-run on the downside as well as the upside, and companies with rising profits and falling share prices quickly turn into great opportunities. Therefore, should Visa, MasterCard, and American Express continue to fall, investors would be wise to consider them.

The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $77.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.18. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.5% return against the $77.50 commitment, or a 8.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to AXP's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless American Express Co. sees its shares fall 5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $76.32 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.18 from $77.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.2% annualized rate of return.|Interestingly, that annualized 8.2% figure actually exceeds the 1.1% annualized dividend paid by American Express Co. by 7.1%, based on the current share price of $81.56. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 4.97% to reach the $77.50 strike price.
http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/11/11/dow-morning-report-are-dividend-stocks-in-danger.aspx|11/11/2013|0|"AT&T"|0|The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is slowly continuing its impressive record run this morning, up a modest 14 points just after 11 a.m. EST on optimism that the bull market in stocks can continue so long as global economic conditions keep improving and unforeseen negative events don't weigh on corporate performance. But among the Dow's 30 component companies, top-yielding dividend stocks AT&T (NYSE: T) , Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have underperformed the average over the past six months, raising questions about their ability to match the Dow's long-term performance.|For AT&T and Verizon, finding growth has been an ongoing struggle. Verizon's massive buyout of Vodafone's stake in the companies' joint venture Verizon Wireless was predicated largely on the difficulty in finding other promising growth opportunities, with the leading U.S. wireless carrier deciding that redoubling focus on the U.S. market was its best chance at maximizing its prospects. AT&T has been reluctant to respond with a major strategic move of its own, in large part because the U.S. market is largely saturated, forcing it to look abroad for higher-risk prospects with better reward potential. Yet the experiences of rural telecom companies, which have seen their legacy landline businesses deteriorate slowly but surely in recent years, show how important it is for AT&T and Verizon to avoid stagnating.|So long as Verizon, AT&T, and Intel can grow, they should be able to trade independently of the bond market. But if their businesses ever stop growing for good, then the stocks could well start to act even more like bond surrogates, and that would make them far less attractive in the eyes of many dividend investors.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2014 expiration for CAT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $80 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.29. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.6% return against the $80 commitment, or a 8.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to CAT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Caterpillar Inc. sees its shares decline 4.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $78.71 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.29 from $80), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.7% annualized rate of return.|Interestingly, that annualized 8.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by Caterpillar Inc. by 5.8%, based on the current share price of $83.95. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 4.73% to reach the $80 strike price.|Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Caterpillar Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for CAT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.

ExxonMobil owns 25% of Australia's Gorgon LNG project. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) owns 25%, and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has the biggest interest at 47.3%. If investors can learn anything from Gorgon it is that massive LNG projects have the tendency to go over budget and suck up significant capex. Its original budget of $37 billion has already expanded by 41%. Even the smaller QCLNG project with an approved capacity of 7.8 million metric tons per year has seen its costs increase by 36%.|Shell has seen its upstream volumes fall in 2013, though LNG volumes helped to stabilize earnings. On the positive side, Chevron saw its third quarter 2013 upstream volumes rise by 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboepd) between the second and third quarters of 2013. This number is so small that it effectively means that Chevron's upstream production was flat. Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil will be quite happy when the Gorgon LNG project comes online in early 2015 and starts bringing in cash flow.|Chevron had upstream volumes of 2,582 mboepd in the second quarter of 2013, while Shell had comparable volumes of 3,026 mboepd. At first glance, it would be easy to compare Shell's profit margin of 4.6% against Chevron's profit margin of 10.6% and say that Chevron's management is superior. The problem is that Chevron is a smaller upstream producer, and its management has more flexibility in choosing upstream investments. Over the next decade, there is a good chance that Chevron will be forced into lower margin projects just like Shell.|SummaryThe Asian LNG market is heating up. New Russian LNG facilities will help ExxonMobil and BP serve Japan, South Korea, and China with less exposure to Australia's cost inflation. Investors should be positive but cautiously remember the experience that ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell have with the Gorgon LNG project.

Given that the U.S. economic recovery has been sluggish and that Europe has fallen back into recession, major tech players were relying on emerging-market growth to drive sales higher. The big question for Cisco investors is whether the company can buck the negative trend that IBM and Hewlett-Packard have set and find ways to keep growing. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Cisco Systems over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Stats on Cisco Systems|Will Cisco earnings live up to expectations? Analysts have made small cuts in recent months to their expectations for Cisco's earnings, reducing full-year fiscal 2014 projections by 1% and 2015 calls by 2%. The stock has declined as well, dropping 10% since early August.|Most of Cisco's drop came in the aftermath of its previous earnings report in August. Despite a double-digit percentage increase in adjusted earnings and a better than 6% rise in revenue year over year, Cisco projected slower sales growth for the October quarter. Moreover, it announced a 5% workforce reduction, forcing investors to wonder if Cisco is going too far to try to boost profit margins and eliminate wasteful spending.|Yet the real challenge that Cisco faces is the same one that IBM and Hewlett-Packard have both struggled with: how to broaden their scope to encompass the entire IT services market. Enterprise solutions now encapsulate just about every aspect of clients' technology infrastructure, ranging from servers for virtual-computing environments that take advantage of cloud-based solutions to analytical tools to help business customers make best use of the information they collect on their respective client bases. Cisco risks being pulled in so many different directions that it loses focus on its core, lucrative networking business -- just as Hewlett-Packard lost its way with its hardware business and is now having to shift gears abruptly to compete.|Cisco isn't the only company having to deal with sluggish revenue. IBM saw year-over-year sales drop 4% in its third quarter, with emerging-market trends looking particularly ugly. Even though IBM and Hewlett-Packard have both been able to keep profits high, neither they nor Cisco can rely solely on efficiency gains to drive earnings growth.|One huge potential area for growth for Cisco could come from the continued push toward greater connectivity. With new innovations like wearable technology on the rise, Cisco will see greater demand for equipment to help keep devices interconnected, boosting sales in a key area for the company.|In the Cisco earnings report, watch to see if CEO John Chambers has a more optimistic outlook on the economy and the company's prospects. In past quarters, Chambers has often cast a negative light on Cisco's near-future results, and if he does so again, investors might once again send the stock downward.|Learn more about where Cisco could grow nextInterested in how Cisco might be able to profit from the next tech revolution?

Nevertheless, it's worth paying particular attention when the industry leader falls on hard times, as Digital Realty is the biggest of the group. Digital Realty's cascade downward likely has investors nervous, and the critical question now is whether Digital Realty is as cheap as it seems on the surface.|By contrast, Digital Realty's two smaller competitors have had nothing but great things to say about their own businesses. DuPont Fabros posted stellar 63% growth in adjusted funds from operation in its third quarter, year over year, and CoreSite Realty produced 17.5% FFO growth in the third quarter.Furthermore, both DuPont and CoreSite increased their full-year 2013 guidance, indicating that Digital Realty's struggles are not widespread through the industry.|Investors might immediately decide to ignore Digital Realty in favor of DuPont Fabros or CoreSite Realty within the data center space based on the latter two's fundamentals. The temptation is understandable, but it should be noted that you'll have to pay a significant premium for DuPont Fabros and CoreSite Realty, which each trade for 17 times full-year 2013 FFO expectations. Moreover, due to Digital Realty's falling share price, it provides a greater dividend yield of several hundred basis points over its two peers. DuPont Fabros and CoreSite Realty yield 4% and 3.3%, respectively.

In addition, management is anticipating robust demand from China as customers in the region upgrade to budget smartphones from 2G devices. In short, Skyworks is poised to benefit from different quarters. That's why, investors should hold on to it even though it's trading close to its 52-week high.|The partnership with General Electric, in particular, could turn out to be quite fruitful. As Skyworks CEO David Aldrich pointed out, General Electric recently stated that it will integrate machine-to-machine communications across its entire industrial portfolio. This will include jet engines, locomotives, turbines, and medical devices, and represent millions of GE products.|General Electric is expanding the Internet of Things to industrial applications, calling it the "Industrial Internet." It recently launched 14 new products as a part of its Industrial Internet initiative, as it looks to make machines smarter. GE expects this initiative to boost GDP by $10 trillion-$15 trillion over the next couple of decades. Hence, Skyworks could stand to gain substantially from this initiative of GE.

Novartis (NYSE: NVS) CEO Joe Jimenez just days later confirmed reports that his company could also be looking to sell its animal health business.|Will Merck make the move?To understand why Merck is thinking about some sort of divestiture, take a look at its year-to-date performance. Shares are up about 14%, well below other big pharma rivals. The company is slashing its workforce by 20% in the wake of declining sales.|Merck's animal health business generated $3.4 billion in sales last year, accounting for slightly more than 7% of the company's total revenue. The consumer care unit -- including Claritin, Dr. Scholl's foot-care products, and Coppertone sun-protection products -- brought in $2 billion, or 4% of total revenue.|Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin thinks that splitting out the two business units could yield roughly $12.5 billion in additional shareholder value. While Merck probably wouldn't get quite as high of a premium valuation for its animal health unit that Zoetis commands, Rubin's estimate seems to be realistic.|Merck's Frazier says the company is working to determine whether the animal health and consumer care businesses "produce the most value inside our portfolio or outside our portfolio." That answer seems likely to be "outside."|What isn't as clear, though, is which route Merck might take to divest those units and how quickly it would move to do so.

One such company is Nike (NYSE: NKE) , a leading player in the athletic footwear and apparel market space. Nike recently released strong fiscal 2014 results, and there are good reasons why its robust performance can continue in the future.|A look at NikeNike is by far the world's largest athletic shoe manufacturer, with an expected market share of close to 50%. More impressively, despite its size it still continues to grow. Nike posted revenue growth of 8% in the previous quarter versus the year-ago period, clocking revenue of $7 billion. Nike's growth was driven by strong demand for its products in both developed and emerging markets.|Nike, however, has had a continually frustrating experience in China, the world's fastest growing market. The company has not been able to make much progress there, and the story continued in the first quarter as revenue declined 3% year-over-year. In addition, sales of footwear items were down 7%. Nike has strong competition in China from brands like Li Ning and Peak, and it seems that it still hasn't gotten the right product (at least as far as the Chinese market is concerned).|It is expected that the Chinese athletic apparel and footwear market will be worth $32 billion by 2017, and Nike will certainly want to capitalize on it. Indeed, the market in China is huge and can be a good growth driver for any company that can strike a chord with consumers. Nike is taking corrective steps to reset this trend going forward. The company is primarily focusing on delivering products that Chinese consumers want.|Skechers enjoying great growthOn the other hand, Nike's peer, Skechers, has been performing well in both international and emerging markets. Skechers is doing well in China, where Nike is having a tough time. Skechers has been recovering well from its 2011 "toning shoes" fiasco, and shares have been outperforming Nike.|To attain that level of revenue, it has to snatch market share from other players. For that reason, the company is aggressively marketing its products, and its marketing budget (as a percentage of revenue) equaled Nike's last year. Also, Under Armour's revenue grew an impressive 25% in 2012 to $1.83 billion. However, an important thing to note is that only 6% of it was contributed by markets outside of North America, according to The Wall Street Journal. In comparison, Nike gets almost three-fifths of its revenue from outside the U.S., which means that Under Armour has a huge opportunity to expand its business abroad.|However, Under Armour is expensive and is still trying to cut its teeth on a big scale. Nike is a tried and trusted player in the market and has solid brand presence. It trades at 26 times earnings and carries a dividend that yields 1.10%. In comparison, Under Armour is quite expensive at a P/E ratio of 57 times, and doesn't pay a dividend.|Bottom lineNike has delivered consistent results and has a promising future. The company has posted continuous growth in its top line and bottom line, and is working on different strategies to grow its business further. Its aggressive expansion plans in emerging markets should fetch good returns for investors in the long run.|On the other hand, both Under Armour and Skechers are looking at international markets to grow their businesses. They might be expensive compared to Nike (with Skechers having a P/E of 35), but both are smaller players and have posted superior growth numbers. Hence, investors looking for more aggressive plays in this space should take a look at them.

Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) spun off its branded pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) at the beginning of the year. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) followed suit with an IPO of animal health business Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS) a few weeks later.|Pfizer also has rewarded shareholders with a return of nearly 25% so far in 2013, thanks in part to the success of its cancer drug lineup. Zoetis started off strong but is up less than 3% year to date. Part of the issue, in my view, is that the stock was priced at a premium from the outset. However, even with subpar stock performance from Zoetis, Pfizer accomplished its purpose of unlocking shareholder value.|What isn't as clear, though, is which route Merck might take to divest those units and how quickly it would move to do so. Selling to another organization could be the preferred path rather than the spin-off approaches taken by Abbott and Pfizer.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/11/pfizer-patent-cliff-worries-not-a-major-concern.aspx|11/11/2013|0|"Pfizer"|0|Pfizer: Patent Cliff Worries Not a Major Concern|The halcyon days for the pharmaceutical industry when the sector easily expanded its revenues by 10% to 15% per annum, and earnings at an even brisker clip seem to be long gone. Loss of patent protection coupled with the dearth of new drugs being churned out by research labs have taken a hit on the bottom lines of large pharmaceuticals, and have been holding down a number of pharma stocks in recent times. But there are still several notable top performers that have been defying patent cliff concerns dogging the industry. One of these is giant drugmaker Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) .|Pfizer's stock has gained 23.5% year to date, which is considerably more than the 7% it gained in all of 2012. Although Pfizer will in time lose patent protection on some of the drugs it manufactures, the better-than-expected third-quarter results could easily offset any concerns about possible future revenue losses. Pfizer's biggest concern had been Viagra's imminent loss of patent protection, but the patent expiration date has been pushed back to 2020.|Pfizer reported earnings of $3.86 billion, or $0.58 per share, on Oct. 29; that EPS was $0.02 better than consensus estimates. The company's 73.85% operating margin and 20.59% net margin are higher than the industry average.|Revenue declined slightly by 2% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The lighter-than-expected revenue of $12.5 billion was as a result of the negative impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates and not due to weaker sales. What's even better is that several analysts expect Pfizer's earnings per share to grow 6% in 2014, marking the first time the big pharma will grow its earnings on a year-to-year basis since it lost U.S. patent protection for blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.|Cancer drugs a silver bulletPfizer's cancer drugs were the main highlight of the third-quarter report. Pfizer's oncology division continues to be in the pink of health. Pfizer's CEO Ian Read singled out the firm's new cancer drugs Xalkori and Inlyta as the key drugs that helped boost Pfizer's oncology segment by 26%. Revenues from Inlyta and Xalkori rose by 186% and 92%, respectively.|Other patent-protected cancer-fighting drugs such as Celebrex and Lyrica have also been doing well. Pfizer made it abundantly clear during the earnings call that it would continue to focus strongly on cancer-fighting drugs in the future. The production of palbociclib, a drug designed to treat recurrent breast cancer, is already in phase 3 trials.|Expanding pipeline and share buybacksOther than breast cancer drug palbociclib, Pfizer has a number of other promising drugs in the pipeline as well. These include drugs for lowering cholesterol levels in the body, for treating type 2 diabetes, and for treating osteoarthritis pain.|Apart from the drugs in its pipeline, Pfizer has also been aggressively buying back its own shares. This year alone, the company has bought back 13.1 billion of its shares, with 3.8 billion purchased in the third quarter alone. This aptly demonstrates the firm has good cash flow and the financial wherewithal to do so.|Pfizer peers face looming loss of patent protectionPfizer's peers are not so lucky when it comes to imminent loss of patent protection. Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE: TEVA) , AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) , Novartis (NYSE: NVS) all face loss of patent protection on some of their leading drugs in 2014.|Novartis will lose patent protection on two of its leading drugs in 2014. One of these is Sandostatin LAR, with 1.5 billion sales in 2012; the cancer drug goes off patent in June. The other drug, hypertension drug Exforge, will lose patent protection in October. Novartis sold Exforge worth $1.4 billion in 2012. The two drugs combined accounted for 5% of Pfizer's $58.5 billion 2012 sales.|Pfizer investors are luckier than many when it comes to near-term loss of patent protection. The company's $2 billion-a-year drug Viagra is no longer in danger of losing patent protection any time soon. Pfizer has several promising drugs in the pipeline which could turn out to be blockbusters, and in my opinion its stock is worth a closer look.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/11/potential-for-anti-ngf-agents-builds-with-partners.aspx|11/11/2013|0|"Pfizer"|1|This hold affected not only leader Pfizer but also Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) fulranumab, AstraZeneca's MEDI578, and Regeneron and Sanofi-Aventis' partnership on REGN475/SAR164877. All trials were halted, either as ordered by the Food and Drug Administration or voluntarily, and the pharmaceutical giants yielded a potential $11 billion market.|Pfizer, however, is attempting to restart trials and overcome the safety hurdle in the first half of 2014 with submission of new non-clinical data. In spring 2012, an FDA advisory panel recommended lifting the hold on the class of drug, stating unanimously that benefits outweighed the risks. Doing so would place tanezumab back into its late-stage pipeline for Pfizer, as well as allow for J&J, AstraZeneca and Regeneron to restart their trials.|It has been over a year since the outside panel recommended the FDA lift the hold, and while the FDA is not obligated to that panel, it seems that it may take the recommendation. The panel also made the recommendation to carefully select patients who would yield the greatest benefit, and coupled with the promising clinical data in studies prior to the hold, the FDA could reasonably allow trials to restart, albeit very likely with restrictions. Lifting the hold would be the first step, and for Pfizer, one that means a $200 million upfront payout from Eli Lilly.|If the hold were to be lifted, Pfizer could use certainly use the boost of a potential blockbuster returning to its pipeline. Third quarter earnings were improved for Pfizer, but only modestly so, especially as compared to the consistently stable J&J. Meanwhile, the partnership between Eli Lilly and Pfizer is somewhat out of the norm, as Eli Lilly rarely partners with other companies and has recently been fielding its own critics of its own risky endeavors into late-stage Alzheimer's therapies.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/11/is-this-orphan-drug-maker-in-trouble.aspx|11/11/2013|0|"Pfizer"|2|Protalix BioTherapeutics (NYSEMKT: PLX) , an Israeli company focused on the treatment of Gaucher disease and other rare diseases, recently reported its third-quarter earnings. But its core business -- a joint venture with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) to sell its Gaucher disease drug Elelyso (also known as Uplyso), showed major signs of weakness.|Protalix and Pfizer's Elelyso, as well as most other approved Gaucher disease drugs, treat type 1.|Protalix's weak third quarterUnder the terms of the Elelyso joint venture, Protalix retains marketing rights for the drug within Israel, while Pfizer holds the rights to market it abroad. However, Protalix retains a profit-sharing agreement that entitles it to 40% of Pfizer's profits.|During its third quarter, Protalix reported that its revenue had declined 38% year over year to $2.3 million. $1.4 million of that $2.3 million was generated by Israeli sales of Elelyso, with the remainder coming from deferred revenue from Pfizer's original payment of $65 million at the joint venture's inception. Revenue from its joint venture with Pfizer also declined 35% to $1.1 million -- indicating that the treatment is having a lot of trouble gaining traction.|Sanofi and Shire's Gaucher treatments are dominating the marketProtalix and Pfizer's treatment hasn't made much of an impact in the market for Gaucher disease due to increased competition from Shire and Sanofi's (NYSE: SNY) rare disease subsidiary, Genzyme. Sales of Elelyso pale in comparison to both treatments, which are also enzyme replacement therapies. Both Vpriv and Elelyso are biosimilar (generic) versions of Cerezyme.|The one major advantage that Protalix and Pfizer have with Elelyso is with pricing -- Elelyso costs $150,000 per patient per year, compared to the $170,000 and $200,000 it costs per year of Vpriv and Cerezyme, respectively. However, Protalix and Pfizer will have to expand the drug's reach into more markets to capitalize on that strength -- which looks tough considering that sales are falling by the double digits before the drug has even gotten off the ground.|Looking into the futureSlumping sales of Elelyso obviously represent a much bigger problem for Protalix than it does for Pfizer, which can easily absorb the losses from the failing joint venture and move on. However, that doesn't mean that Protalix is a lost cause yet.|Although Protalix's Fabry disease treatment could become the company's second lifeline, it will face some steep challenges entering the market split between Shire and Sanofi. In addition, if Protalix successfully completes its phase 3 trials of PRX-102, there's still the question of a marketing partner -- will Pfizer partner up with Protalix after Elelyso's weak start?
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/11/3-keys-to-your-investment-in-dr-pepper-snapple-gro.aspx|11/11/2013|0|"Coca-Cola"|1|For most companies, there are only a handful of key factors that determine shareholders' return. Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE: DPS) is no exception. Although it faces stiff competition from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP), Dr Pepper's future stock price will be determined by its ability to focus on the three strategic factors outlined below.|(1) Hispanics are key to Dr Pepper's growth strategyAccording to a report by Coca-Cola, Mexico is the largest per-capita consumer of carbonated soft drinks in the world. Moreover, Dr Pepper has discovered that Hispanics prefer flavors (such as Sunkist soda) to colas. This presents an enormous opportunity for the company as the Hispanic population continues to grow in the United States.|(2) License agreements with Coca-Cola and PepsiCoMany people do not think about the logistics of distributing millions of caseloads of soft drinks to stores throughout North America, but it is an important part of the business. Distribution requires a large fleet of trucks that deliver products to stores and complex computer systems to optimize delivery. In short, it is extremely expensive to build a distribution network, so Dr Pepper largely relies on third-party distributors.|Two of the company's primary distributors arerivals PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. PepsiCo paid Dr Pepper $900 million for the right to distribute the company's products in North America through 2030. Coca-Cola paid $715 million for the right to distribute products in the United States and Canada, but also gives Dr Pepper access to its fountain accounts.|The benefit of allowing PepsiCo and Coca-Cola to distribute the company's products is clear: instead of having to build and maintain an expensive distribution network, Dr Pepper can invest in marketing and return capital to shareholders. Unfortunately, there are also drawbacks to these arrangements. Beverage Dailycites analyst Bonnie Herzog's concern that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are not promoting Dr Pepper like they would their own brands.|(3) Dr Pepper returns most of its free cash flow to shareholdersA wonderful byproduct of not having to maintain an expensive distribution system is that Dr Pepper has relatively low capital expenditures. Dr Pepper's capital spending is just 2.4% of annual revenue. By contrast, PepsiCo's PP&E expenditure is 5% of revenue and Coca-Cola's is 3.2%.|As a result, the company is able to return a large amount of cash to shareholders. The company increased its dividend for the fifth consecutive year in 2013 and has ample free cash flow to continue raising it. Moreover, Dr Pepper used the $1.6 billion earned from the PepsiCo and Coca-Cola distribution agreements to repurchase stock in 2010 and 2011 at favorable prices. As a result, the company has reduced its share count by 18.5% since 2010.

However, October was not Boeing's month. First, VivaAerobus placed an order for 40 A320-family jets -- a deal worth an estimated $4 billion, and then Boeing lost the JAL contract to Airbus -- estimated to be worth $9.5 billion (although discounts are likely). This came with the added displeasure of jeopardizing Boeing's manufacturing arrangements with Japanese manufacturers Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, and Fuji.|Further, these losses were compounded by the fact that this year Airbus has outsold Boeing. As of October, Boeing had sold 1,102 jets. Airbus had sold 1,286.|Billions to the rescue Airbus' victory over Boeing in commercial airline sales is clearly not great news for investors. However, it's also not time to panic. In its latest quarterly report, Boeing's commercial airline third-quarter revenue increased to $14.0 billion. Plus, operating margin improved to 11.6% on higher delivery volume and continued strong operating performance. Moreover, Boeing reported that it booked 200 net orders during the quarter for commercial airplanes, and backlog remained high, with 4,800 airplanes valued at a record $345 billion.|What to watchIt's worrisome that Airbus would take two of Boeing's airlines and beat it in orders, as it shows that Airbus is kicking the competition -- and doing a good job at that. However, Boeing is completely up to the challenge, and I imagine it'll come back fighting. Further, for its latest third-quarter results, Boeing had a total backlog of $415 billion, a revenue increase of 11% thanks to higher commercial deliveries, and an operating cash-flow increase of $4.3 billion. Consequently, Boeing has a significant safety net -- for now. If Boeing continues to lose key customers to Airbus, or any other airplane manufacturer, it might be time to re-evaluate your holdings. But for now, there isn't cause to panic.|Fuel up on dividendsDividend stocks, like Boeing, can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notability of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine. With this in mind, our analysts sat down to identify the absolute best of the best when it comes to rock-solid dividend stocks, drawing up a list in this free report of nine that fit the bill. To discover the identities of these companies before the rest of the market catches on, you can download this valuable free report by simply clicking here now.|Now none of us saw the contract proposals but I bet the biggest issue was with the delivery delays because Boeing hasn't increased production capacity due to worrying more about quarterly reports and share value. This is becoming the bigger reason why US corps are losing out to foreign firms.|Maybe it's time to worry about the government's involvement in business on behalf of unions. Right now Boeing is having problems in Seattle with a mandatory minimum wage issue and government involvement in their business. Let free markets reign and prosperity will follow. Although, that does mean that people will have to work and think for themselves.|mickeyfinn234, you're totally ignorant on your comments. Boeing is not having a problem with any mandatory minimum wage or government involvement. Next time stop to think before you post such drivel, if you're capable of actually thinking at all.|The fact is the Boeing 737 fuselage is slighlty narrower than the Airbus 320, the high density seating used on the 737 has to be narrower thus less shoulder room. This was a conscious decision made by Boeing when they developed the next gen 737s, as it gives them a slight econmy edge at the expense of passenger comfort. This was OK when the 737 was short haul but now they are transcontinental it is not so good. I am a typical regular business traveller and the fact is on long domestic flights say East to West Coast, I deliberatley avoid 737 flights and always go with A320 flights purely for this reason.|When comparing the cabin width, the A320 is wider at knee level, but the two cabins are of exactly the same width at armrest level. The 737NG wall is flatter, and due to curvature, the A320 wall actually encroaches more into the top of the seats. I believe that the source of info was Boeing, so like anything in Seattle vs. Toulouse/Hamburg, take it as it comes. I don't want to start another international incident, but I found the data interesting.|Ever since McDonnell Douglass people took over Boeing on a hostile trading stocks trading. Then theses executives move Boeing headquarters out of Seattle. Now they are hoping to remove Boeing out of Washington State to South Carolina. Ha ha ha ha these are the real problem of the real American commercial airplanes manufacturers. Greed and power has been the self destruction of the whole affair. We the Americans people we need to come up with a new Air planes manufacturers. We used to have Hughes, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell-Douglas, and Boeing. Why now we only have Boeing who is on a decline due to the mergers and stock buy out. We need to start a new one. I bet if Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Warren Buffet. T Pikens and many others putt together to save the industry from completely vanish from the USA to China, Japan and Europe. It is happening. Sad sad it is hurting me and my pride.|Cash flow and operating margin will always look good as long as there is a backlog of orders. Those numbers only require that Boeing continue making airplanes that it has already sold. Easy money.|Boeing's sales problem isn't a sales problem at all. It's a conscious decision on their part to save money by investing less in R&D. This produces greater short term returns. But you can see where it is headed. Aerospace requires absolutely massive investment in R&D to compete... and the consequences of failing to make those investments will not show up for many years.|Nevertheless, Boeing will continue to be wildly successful until its older designs stop selling, at which point we will realize that they have given up the ability to come up with new designs in a timely fashion. Unless they completely change their focus and start rebuilding their development ability, this will eventually spell the end of the company's salad days.|Don't worry. If the Boeing commercial aircraft branch fails, the company will be kept afloat by huge governmental orders, like military tankers or whatever, in which they cannot lose. But even in commercial aviation, success is virtually guaranteed as long as the U.S. government acts as an extended Boeing sales force in various countries. Surely, so do the Europeans for Airbus. Same game. Nothing to worry.

General Electric claims the cheaper devices will bring the cost of hydrogen down to $3.00 per kilogram which is the energy equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. When such devices are powered from solar photovoltaic cells the individual economies of both hydrogen and PV generated electricity will be forever lowered. The combining of the two technologies is the game changer because hydrogen will become not only the standard storage solution for solar generated electricity it will also replace higher cost gasoline and substitute all oil based energies.

General Electric's finance unit, for example, recently inked a deal to provide truck financing to companies that sign fuel supply contracts with Clean Energy. That's on top of an earlier agreement between the two companies and Ferus Natural Gas Fuels to develop liquified natural gas projects serving industries "...such as long-haul trucking, rail, mining, marine, and oil and gas services."|And those aren't the only natural gas vehicle fuel endeavors General Electric is working on. Fleet vehicles are a big market, but the consumer market is bigger. That's where a GE effort to build home fueling stations for natural gas powered autos comes in. Although the gasoline infrastructure will be hard to displace, letting people fuel from home could be a game changer.|Of course you don't buy General Electric as a natural gas play, since it is an industrial and financial conglomerate. But GE is clearly trying to get itself into the natural gas market, and partnerships with Clean Energy are a good start. But Clean Energy is hardly the only industry participant. Royal Dutch Shell, and its 20,000+ American gas stations (44,0000+ globally), is also a big player.|On the horizonNatural gas isn't a big player in the vehicle fuel market, but it likely will be in the future.

With hopes of catching up to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and its rival prostate-cancer drug Zytiga fading, can Dendreon stay ahead of promising upstart Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) in the immunotherapy space and keep its high-growth dreams alive?|Much of the stock's decline came right after Dendreon released its second-quarter earnings results in August. The company didn't lose quite as much money as investors had expected, but it also didn't bring in as much revenue as projected. The kiss of death, though, was Dendreon's guidance that year-over-year revenue from Provenge wouldn't grow, once again demonstrating the challenge that the prostate-cancer treatment has faced in gaining traction. Johnson & Johnson's Zytiga has managed to hold onto too much of the market, even though Dendreon finished enrollment in trials combining Provenge with Zytiga in an attempt to broaden its use.

With more than $400 billion in annual sales, the company has to engage in massive discounts and sales promotions in order to keep a one to two percent annual growth rate in sales. This trade-off hurts the giant's profitability enormously.|China's huge emerging middle class could help Wal-Mart solve its sales growth problem. China's retail sales were already huge in 2010 and amounted to nearly $2.1 trillion. At the current pace, by 2015 China is poised to jump to the position of third largest consumer market globally behind only the U.S. and Japan.|Aware of these facts, Wal-Mart has been opening stores in China since 1996. However, China still represents a small proportion of Wal-Mart's total revenue at only $10 billion in 2012. A fierce landscape and the struggles of other U.S. retailers in capturing market share have made huge retail chains such as Costco (NASDAQ: COST) avoid China for the time being. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) has done very poorly there. How does Wal-Mart plan to capture market share in China?|Wal-Mart's strategy to conquer the fierce Chinese retail spaceWal-Mart is planning an aggressive expansion in China. Mike Duke, Wal-Mart's CEO and President, recently announced the company will be opening 110 new super-centers and Sam's Clubs over the next three years. At the same time, the company -- which has already closed 11 stores in the country -- plans to close 15 to 30 more stores over the next 18 months.|At the same time, Wal-Mart plans to stock all stores with upgraded, fresh merchandise. New distribution centers will be opened to ensure faster distribution and more efficient supply chain management. It seems the retail giant has finally understood that low prices aren't enough to get market share in China. As Forbes contributor Walter Loeb mentions, Chinese consumers are increasingly discerning and willing to spend time checking product quality before buying to ensure freshness.|Final Foolish takeawayAfter opening its first store in 1996, Wal-Mart has learned a lot about how to be competitive in the world's second largest economy. The new approach the company is taking sounds more realistic and will hopefully contribute toward improving the giant's top-line performance. However, although Wal-Mart's integrated strategy -- from adding more e-commerce exposure to improving its distribution network -- does sound promising, it's important to keep in mind that the company still has plenty of things to learn about China's rapid consumer market changes.|Wal-Mart's only one company on this free list!Dividend stocks can make you rich.

Currently, the company sports a market capitalization of more than $251 billion and reported revenue of nearly $469.2 billion in 2012. To commemorate this miraculous achievement, I believe that it would be wrong not to celebrate some of the more interesting things about the company that have made it what it is today, for better or worse.|1988 was a big year for Wal-Mart... literallyDespite the growth that Wal-Mart saw throughout its early years, 1988 is the year that might literally have determined the course the company would eventually take. In 1988, the company opened its first Wal-Mart Supercenter in Washington, Missouri. In addition to providing the standard products of a traditional Wal-Mart store, the company's Supercenter model debuted with a range of options for consumers. These consisted of tire and oil change shops, video rental stores, portrait studios, and more.|You have to walk before you runIn 1991, after 29 years in operation, the company decided that the time was right to finally make the bold step toward expanding internationally. Although such a decision can be a scary one that may not always work according to plan, Wal-Mart's decision to open their first store abroad in Mexico City served as a stepping stone for it to reach out and grab a large piece of the rest of the world. By 1994, the company operated an impressive 96 stores in Mexico alone.|Talk about being left behindIn general, people don't like the feeling of being left behind because of the sensation of loneliness it incites. Now I can't speak for a state, but I know that if Wal-Mart forgot about me until 1995 then I would be pretty lonely. Interestingly enough, this was the case with Vermont. While the company was busy expanding to all parts of the globe including Argentina, Brazil, and Hong Kong, it didn't open a single store in the state of Vermont until 1995. The company already had 2,943 stores by this time, 276 of which were located internationally and generated $93.6 billion in revenue, with $78 billion (or 83.3%) of it coming from domestic markets.|Wal-Mart has been a big-time innovator... in both good and bad waysIn addition to expanding rapidly, Wal-Mart prides itself in being an innovative company. One of the earliest signs of this came about as a result of the company's decision to launch the Wal-Mart Television Network in 1998, whereby it could provide commercials, concert clips, and more for customers to be exposed to.|On top of this interesting achievement, the company also responded to the rising trend of healthier, organic foods being capitallized on by companies like Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) . Since its inception in 1978, Whole Foods has focused primarily on providing healthier alternatives to what traditional grocery stores offered. As the company's concept became more popular, Wal-Mart took notice. In 2006, the company decided to offer a variety of organic alternatives at a price that wouldn't exceed 10% of their non-organic counterparts.|Though this is a good idea in theory since you would expect Wal-Mart to be able to price competitors like Whole Foods out of the market, its efforts appear to be in vain. Whole Foods has seen its revenue increase by 108.6% since Wal-Mart entered the fray. This statement is further bolstered by the fact that Whole Foods has seen its net income rise by an even more impressive 128.4%, from $203.8 million in 2006 to $465.6 million in 2012.|Foolish takeawayFor all the controversy that has grown around Wal-Mart over the past several years, the company has a fascinating history behind it. Though this article hasn't shown much about the ups and downs of the company relative to its peers, I hope that it has at least opened your eyes to the interesting story the company has been able to tell through its triumphs and foibles alike.|Wal-Mart is only one of the stocks on this free list!Dividend stocks can make you rich.

I disagree. There are many examples of why this is both naive and -- excuse my forthrightness -- completely ignorant, but the one that comes most readily to mind is Sam Walton's explanation for why Wal-Mart succeeded in the discount retail business when some many others failed (emphasis added):|While you could argue that Wal-Mart is now falling victim to this very same trend courtesy of Amazon.com and Costco, the validity of the observation remains as true today as it did when Walton wrote it more than a decade ago.

The fuel-efficient, next-generation aircraft will compete with the long-haul offerings of EADS (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) subsidiary Airbus, and will be delivered to its first customers in 2020. But the plane won't be designed entirely in Everett.|Recently, Boeing announced that it would spread a significant portion of the 777X's design among five different American engineering sites, with some contribution from its Russian design center in Moscow.|What's the rationale for splitting up the design of the 777X to centers as far away as the East Coast and Russia?

Today, though, shareholders in these giants are becoming disgruntled because so much money is getting poured back into the business rather than back to shareholders. The slightly ironic facet of this trend, however, is that big oil companies like Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) are returning value to shareholders -- shareholders in companies like Seadrill (NYSE: SDRL) and Core Labs (NYSE: CLB) that is.|The burden of big oilShareholders and analysts may not like it, but big oil companies need to spend gobs of money on mega-projects if they have any hope of growing their production and revenue streams. Chevron and Exxon's Gorgon project that will ship LNG to the Asia-Pacific market is a perfect example of this. The project is estimated to come in at $54 billion and will not be online for a few years. Once it does, though, it will still take years for it to generate a healthy return, even though it will net Chevron 400,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent production. Even more discouraging is the Kashagan oil project, in which Exxon is a partner. The company estimates that it will need to be involved in one of the worlds largest oil finds well past 2040 to make a return on all the investments the company made in infrastructure and exploration to bring the project to fruition.|Another aspect that investors could consider is that big oil isn't going to spend that much money on a whim. So these companies are turning increasingly to Core Labs' reservoir analysis methods to get a better idea of what they can expect in terms of production and ultimate oil recovery from a well. These types of analyses are letting big oil make better investment decisions on prospective plays. Chevron, Exxon, Total, Shell -- all of these companies are employing Core Labs, and the work on many of these mega-projects has translated into four straight quarters of record-breaking profitability. Also, work in emerging, complex oil formations such as in Russia and the coasts of Brazil and West Africa will provide ample projects over the next several years in this field.

Most of them had huge growth spurts in order to gain entry into the Dow, but having achieved that distinction, many Dow components slow down to growth rates more typical of mature companies in aging industry. Still, a few companies have what it takes to produce some strong growth rates. Today, let's look at Visa (NYSE: V) , Home Depot (NYSE: HD) , and Disney (NYSE: DIS) , which sport some of the best growth prospects of any Dow stock and therefore are the first stocks that growth investors should explore.|Building successHome Depot is an obvious growth candidate now that the housing market has turned around, but what many investors don't realize is that the home-improvement retailer did a good job of finding growth even before home prices bottomed. Rather than relying on traditional business linked to new homeowners furnishing their homes, Home Depot instead looked at ways to convince existing homeowners -- many of whom were essentially stuck with homes they wouldn't ordinarily have hung on to -- to remodel and refurbish their homes either to make them more saleable or more livable.|Home Depot has competition, but it has largely left it behind.

Home Depot also dealt this week with bit of a PR nightmare this week, after a Tweet regarded as racially insensitive was sent from the company's account.

This holiday season is extremely important for Best Buy as investors need to see some serious improvements if the company wants to keep the stock from falling apart. There's plenty of competition, from online retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) to big-box retailer Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , so the company needs to be at the top of its game. Here are three reasons that Best Buy will dominate this holiday season.|Wal-Mart offers a similar program. For obvious reasons, Amazon does not. This gives traditional brick-and-mortar retailers a distinct advantage over Amazon and other online retailers.|Best Buy is marketing itself as the ultimate holiday showroom, a brilliant strategy in my opinion, because these mini-stores greatly differentiate the company from other brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart. Many consumers know little about gadgets and technology, and these mini-stores give Best Buy the unique ability to allow customers to try out the full gamut of devices in an environment designed specifically for exactly that.|Wal-Mart and other big-box stores simply can't match Best Buy in this area. Having an associate explain a Windows 8 device, along with all of Microsoft's services that go along with it, is something that you won't see at Wal-Mart. The fact that Microsoft signed the mini-store agreement in the first place is a testament to the power of Best Buy as a platform, and this gives Best Buy an edge over other retailers.

In addition to the usual complaints about rock-bottom pay, terrible hours, and shoddy benefits, Wal-Mart is perpetuating another major risk to overall business health. Investors should think long and hard about what this means for the long term.|Sadly, many companies pay their workers just as badly or even worse than Wal-Mart, even though it takes most of the flak.|Maybe that's because it's the Godzilla of retail. Wal-Mart's market cap is $252 billion. Despite its recent financial disappointments and the economic difficulties hitting its core customers, in the last 12 months Wal-Mart has raked in $473 billion in sales.|In addition, Wal-Mart employs a whopping 2.2 million people all over the world. Unfortunately, they're not paid very well and often have to apply for public assistance to make up for their shoddy paychecks. Investors who feel like boosted profits are better for their own stock returns should consider that by paying its employees low wages, Wal-Mart is shoving costs onto the public.

Yet in the long run, Hologic hopes that its specialization in creating diagnostic products and medical imaging systems aimed at important women's health issues will give it a competitive edge over larger rivals General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Siemens (NYSE: SI) , both of which have large health-care segments of their own.|Hologic has become an important player in the women's health field, with medical devices that include mammography imaging systems, screening tests, and equipment that measures bone density to assess the onset of osteoporosis. But General Electric has a long history of building its own imaging equipment that competes with Hologic in covering similar conditions, and Siemens also makes products aimed at addressing women's health issues. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Hologic over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Yet many investors aren't convinced that Hologic can tap the full potential of its products, especially with giants like General Electric and Siemens looming over the small company. Analyst expectations for sluggish growth in Aptima sales as well as its NovaSure endometrial ablation equipment and its bone imaging equipment hurt Hologic's share price in September, even as digital mammography technology in its Selenia system could be a big driver of long-term growth. General Electric came out last year with an ultrasound breast-cancer screening device that gave GE both screening and diagnosis tools using ultrasound, and Siemens has also developed devices designed to provide more information on women's health issues.|In the Hologic earnings release, watch to see how the company's various segments perform. Hologic has plenty of promise in the many areas of women's health it serves, and even with General Electric and Siemens as rivals, Hologic could start to ramp up its growth if it can get more exposure for its products.

Truth be told, I am surprised, too. And with AbbVie's valuation having surpassed large-cap rivals, like Pfizer (PFE), AbbVie's pipeline, which includes blockbuster drug Humira, has suddenly come into question. Not only do I believe these fears are overblown, but I also think -- expensive or not -- investors can still do well in AbbVie stock.|In the case of AbbVie, what's interesting is that over the past couple of quarters, I've heard nothing but complaints from analysts about Humira's long-term performance. The concern continues to be that rival products -- Xeljanz from Pfizer and Apremilast from Celgene (CELG) -- would eat into Humira's growth and apply margin pressure.|All told, it was not a breathtaking quarter, but to the extent it justified the Street's perpetual bearishness, I don't believe it does. Now, at around $47 per share and a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, AbbVie stock is certainly not cheap when compared to Pfizer, which has a P/E of 8. But with improving cash flows AbbVie stock should climb toward the mid- to high $50's before Humira runs out of steam.

The arrangement not only covers the calls of AT&T customers, but also any call that travels through its telecom infrastructure.|While most of the calls in question are made overseas, some calls to and from the U.S. are included in the data haul, according to the report. Because the CIA is not allowed to spy on Americans living in the U.S., the identities of those callers are masked. In some cases, the FBI may issue an administrative subpoena to compel AT&T to provide uncensored data.|According to the Times, AT&T's participation in the program is voluntary and not compelled by a court order.|AT&T(T, Fortune 500) did not confirm or deny the reported deal with the CIA, but it did say that sometimes the company is paid by governments to provide information.|"In all cases, whenever any government entity anywhere seeks information from us, we ensure that the request and our response are completely lawful and proper," said AT&T in a statement to CNNMoney. "Like all telecom providers, we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided. We do not comment on questions concerning national security."|AT&T has come under fire in the past for its relationship with the U.S. government. The company's cooperation with the NSA on the Bush Administration's wireless wiretapping program was the subject of a class action lawsuit.

But by 11 a.m. EST, the Dow had given up its gains and traded down 29 points.

Even though AT&T keeps information about American callers private, the debate over privacy could put the phone giant into an unfavorable spotlight as political wrangling on the issue continues.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/07/vodafone-vs-att-which-stocks-dividend-dominates.aspx|11/07/2013|0|"AT&T"|5|Vodafone vs. AT&T: Which Stock's Dividend Dominates?|Founded in 1983 in the aftermath of a landmark antitrust case, AT&T (NYSE: T) is the largest mobile and fixed telephony services provider in the U.S. Originally divested as Southwestern Bell, today's AT&T is a combination of that company and the AT&T that remained after the antitrust case. The company provides mobile voice and data services to over 107 million subscribers, and also offers broadband, cable TV, and other services to millions of Americans. AT&T has recently been rumored to be considering an acquisition of Vodafone, which does appear to give it an early edge before we even get started in our analysis.|Round 1: Endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Vodafone (formerly known as Racal Telecom) began paying dividends in 1989, and has been paying out ever since. But Vodafone's 25-year dividend streak can't hold a candle to AT&T, whose dividend history dates all the way back to 1893. An uninterrupted dividend streak of 120 years lets AT&T take the endurance crown without breaking a sweat.|Winner: AT&T, 1-0.|Round 2: Stability (dividend-raising streak)Vodafone's dividend payouts fell in 2008 and 2009 due to the financial crisis, according to Dividata, so therefore the telecom giant has only been increasing its dividend since 2010. In contrast, AT&T has been raising its dividend payouts since 1959, resulting in a 55-year dividend-raising streak -- an easy win for the American telecom contender.|Round 5: Flexibility (free cash flow payout ratio) A company that pays out too much of its free cash flow in dividends could be at risk of a cutback, particularly if business weakens. We want to see sustainable payouts, so lower is better. YCharts has a tough time rendering the free cash flow payout ratio of foreign companies, but according to Morningstar, Vodafone's trailing-12-month payout ratio is 260%! That's far less sustainable than AT&T's latest reported free cash flow payout ratio of 61.8%, so the American telecom takes the lead for good in the final round.|Winner: AT&T, 3-2.|Bonus round: Opportunities and threats AT&T may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that AT&T has a better shot at long-term outperformance, thanks to its aggressive expansion plans and its history of providing innovative, reliable, high-quality products and services for more than a century. Vodafone, on the other hand, might find itself acquired by AT&T, since it has been facing severe headwinds in the European markets. The end result for an investment in either company might be a steady stream of AT&T's dividends. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others. Keep your eyes open -- you never know where you might find the next great dividend stock!

Finance, looks at which upgrades and downgrades make sense, and which ones investors should act on. Today, our headlines feature downgrades for two of the biggest names in construction, mining, and agricultural equipment -- Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Deere (NYSE: DE) . On the plus side, though...|Take Caterpillar and Deere for example. Last quarter, sales were up barely 4% at Deere, and down 18% at Cat. Analysts at ISI Group think things will get worse before they get better, too, and this morning announced that they're pulling their buy rating on Caterpillar, and cutting Deere from neutral to a more ominous rating of cautious.|That may sound overly pessimistic, of course, considering that right now, Caterpillar shares only cost a cheap-sounding 16 times earnings, while Deere shares can be had for less than 10 times earnings. But consider:|Of the two, ISI seems slightly more optimistic about Caterpillar's chances, and I agree with the analyst on that score. After what can only be described as a miserable year for cash production in 2012, Caterpillar crawled out of a hole recently, and is now again generating free cash flow superior ($4.9 billion) to what it reports as GAAP net income ($3.5 billion). Arguably, this makes Caterpillar stock somewhat less expensive than it looks -- although if you factor debt into the equation, I'd still argue that at an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 18, Caterpillar is not yet cheap.

Just last month, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) not only reported a massive 42% drop in revenue from its mining equipment division, but also reduced its full-year earnings per share guidance by 15%, citing uncertainty in the mining markets. Caterpillar has also just announced the closing of a highwall miners equipment manufacturing plant in West Virginia as a part of its cost-reduction efforts.|Joy Global may have more reasons to worry than Caterpillar, since it has a much greater exposure to the mining industry. That may explain why Joy projects its 2014 revenue to take a 20% hit even as Caterpillar expects its next year's revenue to be flat to 5% lower. Furthermore, Joy also has a lot at stake in China where growth remains slow. In a recent report, Fitch downgraded its 2014 growth projection for China to 7% from its earlier 7.5% forecast.|Moreover, Joy's shares are nearly half as cheap as Caterpillar's at 8.7 times earnings even after the recent run up. That may sound like a bargain, but investors may have to put up with considerable volatility, at least in the near term. That Joy's shares trade at 16 times forward earnings further suggests that the market expects the company's earnings to fall considerably over the next one year. That doesn't excite me, and I'll rather sit out the discount until the mining industry turns the corner.

Indeed, distributions are so important to Dow stocks that you can typically count on most of the companies to raise their payouts like clockwork each year. November is traditionally when you can expect to see increases from Nike (NYSE: NKE) , Merck (NYSE: MRK) , and Disney (NYSE: DIS) , but will the three Dow components follow through this year? Let's take a look at their dividend histories and prospects for future payout growth.|Of the three stocks, Merck has by far the biggest yield at 3.8%. Yet it also has the poorest prospects for dividend growth, as it only raised its payout by a single penny per share last year and kept its payout unchanged from 2004 to 2011. Considering that the company paid out more in dividends over the past year than it brought in from earnings, along with the drugmaker's patent-cliff challenges, Merck's stinginess isn't all that surprising. Last year, Merck announced its annual increase on Nov. 27; with the company seemingly trying to re-establish regular dividend growth, investors could see a very modest increase later this month to extend the streak to three years.|Nike is in the opposite position of Merck, having plenty of earnings for use in boosting payouts but having a low yield of just 1.1%. The athletic giant has done a good job of accelerating its dividend growth in recent years, though, with increases of 15%-17% in each of the past three years.

This pertains to all the pundits who state that Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) isn't what it used to be. Perhaps I'm missing something, but Procter & Gamble holds a leadership position or significant market share in all of its industry segments against peers Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) . It sells its products in 180 countries and territories, with on-the-ground operations in 70 countries. However, what's most important is results.|The past doesn't guarantee future results. Nor do predictions by company management, for that matter. However, guidance does offer a good clue about what to expect. Procter & Gamble expects strong EPS growth in the second half of fiscal year 2014 thanks to continued top-line growth, productivity savings, and more favorable foreign exchange rates.|Don't make mountains out of molehillsOne of the biggest concerns for Procter & Gamble has been the rise of the value-conscious consumer opting for generic brands in order to save a buck or two. However, Procter & Gamble has still managed to grow its top line. We're not talking about massive growth here. After all, this is a very mature company. However, Procter & Gamble always finds a way to drive the top line, which is often done via innovation.|When consumers look at the shelves, they're not going to see innovative generic products like Crest Complete Multi Benefit, Febreeze CAR Vent Clips, or Olay Body Collections. Hordes of consumers remain loyal to Procter & Gamble brands. Since these brands offer higher quality, many consumers are spoiled. It's easy to move up in quality, but it's very difficult to move down.|With all three companies so impressive, it might seem difficult to choose one over the other. It would be difficult to go wrong with any of them, but there are some deviations. For instance, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive have outperformed Kimberly-Clark on the top line over the past year:|Procter & Gamble|Procter & Gamble is the best of the three at turning revenue into profit, it has been the top performer for debt management, it yields as much as Kimberly-Clark and more than Colgate-Palmolive, and it's trading at a more appealing valuation than Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive.|The bottom lineAll three of the aforementioned are winners. They all know how to cater to consumer demands through marketing and innovation. They're all excellent at driving cash flow and returning capital to shareholders. While Colgate-Palmolive has been growing its top-line faster than Procter & Gamble over the past five years, Procter & Gamble has taken a slight lead recently and it's the most impressive company of the three fundamentally.|Procter & Gamble makes this list, but what are the other two?

This makes sense since soda (or sparkling beverages) drove the company's growth for many years. However, PepsiCo's name might be a little misleading, which is a positive for investors. The company is more than just it's Pepsi soda products -- it also owns Frito-Lay, Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, and Aquafina. That's what you call top-of-the-line diversification.

With 72.41 million people in Hebei, there is plenty of growth potential.|If you think Coca-Cola might be fading, first consider that there are 1.8 billion servings of Coca-Cola products sold per day.|With PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, try to look beyond what these companies currently offer. They're constantly innovating to offer products that match current consumer trends and their marketing power is enormous. Therefore, their potential is always high. If there's a slow stretch, then investors can collect somewhat generous yields while waiting for the next hot product launch or acquisition to drive the top line.|Coca-Cola|The bottom linePepsiCo's product diversification and organic growth, as well as Coca-Cola's brand strength/international growth potential, are likely to make these two companies better investments than Dr Pepper Snapple going forward.

Smaller enterprises like Spartan Stores (NASDAQ: SPTN) , a grocery retailer and distributor inMichigan and Indiana, may take a harder hit than larger, cost-effective stores like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) . For example, during its third quarter conference call, Spartan's CEO informed shareholders that the food stamp reduction is a potential reason for concern and that the reduction could be "a meaningful event for us."|Due to its economies of scale, ability to drive down costs, and many locations, Wal-Mart's chief executive for U.S. stores is more optimistic. William Simon reminded investors that because price matters more to food stamp users, Wal-Mart is more relevant than its higher charging competitors, for instance. And, Mr. Simon is right; but, Wal-Mart estimates that about 18% of all food stamp spending occurs within its store.|Running numbers, we see that Wal-Mart generated roughly $14 billion of its $443.9 billion from food stamps in 2012. Moving forward, assume food stamp users do not use cash to maintain their current purchasing patterns, and assume food stamp users who shop at higher priced stores do not begin shopping at discount retailer Wal-Mart. Combining these assumptions with the $5 billion cut to the food stamp program reveals that Wal-Mart will lose about $900 million in sales in 2014. But with a 0.3% increase in U.S. store sales in 2012 and a profit margin of 3.6%, each dollar is critical for Wal-Mart's bottom line.|After Wal-Mart, about $60 billion is divided among the other companies that accept SNAP funding.

Yet, as important as Telefonica earnings are for company shareholders, another big wild card is whether AT&T (NYSE: T) will decide to make another run at acquiring the telecom outright, or try to buy some of Telefonica's stock or assets. Given the need for AT&T to respond to Verizon's recent deal to take full control of its wireless division, is Telefonica the best fit?|In the eyes of many investors, Telefonica was unfairly punished in the more general rout of European stocks that resulted from recessionary economic conditions on the continent. But as the economy in Europe has started to improve, Telefonica has come back strong. Regardless of AT&T's intentions, Telefonica has made some strategic moves of its own to try to bolster its own competitive position worldwide. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Telefonica over the past quarter, and what we're likely to see in its report.|Much of the interest surrounding Telefonica stock comes from speculation earlier this year that AT&T was talking with Telefonica to discuss a major transaction involving the two companies. For its part, Telefonica has consistently denied reports either of an all-out purchase offer from AT&T -- rumored to have been worth as much as $93 billion -- or of more modest proposals, such as AT&T's taking a minority stake, or buying certain assets. The idea of AT&T trying to grow internationally makes sense in light of Verizon's big expansion domestically, but it increasingly seems that AT&T shouldn't see Telefonica as a willing partner for its aspirations.|In the Telefonica earnings report, watch to see if the company talks about future plans for its dividend. After suspending payments for a year, Telefonica recently made a payout that's about half the size of its pre-suspension amount. Hopefully, dividend investors will see further payout gains if Telefonica can continue to gain ground -- assuming that the company doesn't fall into AT&T's hands in the future.

Chevron (NYSE: CVX) recently had to explain to analysts why it was not worried about the company's rising borrowing activity. In a conference call with investors, Iain Reid, an analyst with Jefferies, raised concerns that Chevron was spending more on capital expenditure and stock buybacks than the company was generating in free cash flow.|Chevron CFO Patricia Yarrington replied that the company was taking a medium-term view on the matter and that with a 12% debt ratio, the company was not worried about its debt load. Indeed, it would appear that debt is almost of no concern to Chevron; according to the company's debt profile on Morningstar, approximately half of the company's $20 billion debt pile demands interest payments of less than 2.5% annually. Considering this, I'm not worried about the company's debt. In fact, borrowing to buy back stock while it is trading at such low levels will guarantee better returns for investors in the future. What's more, additional borrowing should allow Chevron to buy some smaller peers to boost its own flagging production.|Expiring patentsIn addition to IBM and Chevron, Merck (NYSE: MRK) is also aggressively buying back stock with debt, to the extent that the company's long-term debt expanded by 35% between the company's fiscal first and second quarters. This buyback is designed to offset some of the pain the company will feel when a number of its key patents expire. What's more, much of the debt the company has taken on recently has low financing costs, with Morningstar noting that $4 billion of the company's debt carried a fixed rate of interest between 0.6% and 1.3%. Moreover, if rates stay low a bit longer, Merck could refinance some of its higher-rate maturing debt at an even lower cost.

Think Again.|Many investors don't need to be reminded of the tremendous growth that Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has seen over the previous years as the company has emerged a winner following the 2008 recession. The rebound of consumer residential spending and strong housing starts are two strong reasons why shares are up over 100% in the last two years. Outside of favorable economic trends lies a well managed and well positioned company that is well positioned to continue growing over the years.|Appliance sales picking upAnalysts at Morgan Stanley believe in a continued strength in appliance sales. Big ticket leading indicators such as the Association of Home Appliance Manufactures 'AHAM 6' continue to show increasing trends. This indicator measures big ticket appliances such as washers & dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezes, ovens, and ranges.|Many investors don't see Home Depot as a major player in the appliance market, but this is far from true. Home Depot continues to grow and take share in major appliances against competitors such as Sears, which has run into its share of problems recently. Home Depot's initiatives in this area began in the third quarter of 2012 with the company resetting its appliance offering to include brand names such as Whirlpool, Frigidaire, Electrolux, and Samsung. The company commented on appliances during its second quarter 2013 conference call.|Stacking up against the competitionHome Depot operates in a highly competitive environment with Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) being a formidable competitor. Lowe's offers similar, if not identical, products and has a price matching policy. Naturally, investors can do no wrong by buying shares of Lowe's but Home Depot remains a better investment choice.|Historically, Home Depot has trailed Lowe's in gross margin having only surpassed Lowe's in the third quarter of 2011. Home Depot continues to modestly outperform Lowe's on this metric, with a 2012 gross margin of 34.6%, 30 basis points higher than Lowe's.|Another metric that favors an investment in Home Depot over Lowe's is its improvement in SG&A. In 2012 Home Depot reported expenses of 21.9% of sales, down from 23.8% in 2009. At Lowe's, expenses of sales remain elevated at 24% in 2012, only slightly improving from its peak of 24.8% in 2009.|From a business point of view, Home Depot is aggressively expanding within the professional market as the pro customer represents roughly 35% of sales, ahead of 25% at Lowe's. Home Depot is investing in several initiatives that address the pro, including dedicated cashiers, designated parking spaces for the pros, and advanced delivery options to continue winning in this important market segment.|Smaller players can hold an advantageThe emergence of Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL) has become a significant headache for both Home Depot and Lowe's given its rapid expansion in the market. Lumber Liquidators has grown rapidly over the last decade to 300 stores in 2013 compared to just 40 in 2003 and having started with a single location in 1996. This expansion will continue to provide competition to the big box retailers as the company uses a direct sourcing model to put out lower priced items while targeting budget sensitive contractors and the do-it-yourself crowd.|ConclusionHome Depot registered an 11.8% operating margin before the economic downturn and will roughly meet that this year. Management currently has a 12% goal for 2015 which was set in 2012. As business has improved since then, it is possible that management can raise the margin goal during its next analyst day. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are confident that the company can achieve its objectives. Goldman Sachs retail analyst Matt Frasler stated "It's a company that's very much by way of our forecast on its way to achieving its 12% launch from operating margin goal early if anything."|The best aspect of the Home Depot story is that it still provides numerous areas where results can come in better than expected. Faster home renovation growth, better margins, and more cash flow generated all present shareholders with compelling reasons to invest in this retailer even if its stock is currently trading near historical all time highs.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/06/masco-manufactured-its-way-to-a-third-quarter-beat.aspx|11/06/2013|0|"Home Depot"|1|Masco Corporation (NYSE: MAS) reported third quarter earnings on October 28 and the results exceeded analyst expectations. Masco supplies products to the two largest home improvement retailers in the world, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) . Even with the beat, shares have only moved up by a few pennies which left investors scratching their heads and wondering why. Let's take a look and see if this lack of movement is a buying opportunity or if there was something in the report telling us to stay away.|(Image Source: Home Depot Investor Relations)|Home Depot is the largest home improvement retailer with 2,258 locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico, and Guam. In 2012's annual report , Masco stated that approximately 28% of its consolidated net sales were to Home Depot. Both of these numbers should rise in this year's report. This large percentage of sales can be credited to brands like Behr Paints being sold exclusively through Home Depot, a major positive for each brand carried. Home Depot is set to report earnings on November 19, so take a close look at its outlook as it will be an indicator of Masco's future performance.|Lowe's takes the No. 2 spot on the list of the largest home improvement retailers in the world with 1,758 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. In Masco's aforementioned 2012 annual report, it stated that Lowe's made up a little under 10% of consolidated net sales. The many brands Lowe's carries will see growth along with the rise in home improvement projects and remodeling. Having both Home Depot and Lowe's as buyers is the best asset for Masco besides its brand mix. Lowe's reports third quarter results on November 20 and its outlook will be another strong indicator of how Masco will perform in the coming quarters.

You can taste the flame broiling and the onions more, she says.|First, a little history. The Big King is not new. Burger King debuted it several years ago in certain markets. Much like the McDonald's McRib, the Big King developed a fan base wishing for its permanent return. There's even a Facebook page dedicated to this, but if you look at the image of the burger on the page, you'll see the Big King is missing a middle bun.|"I've always been a McDonald's guy," he said afterwards. "Gotta stick with the Big Mac."|That may remain Burger King's biggest dilemma. So many of us have "always" been McDonald's guys. Why buy a Big King when you can buy a Big Mac? The King is about 30 cents cheaper, but will McDonald's feel threatened by this latest Big Mac attack?|"We're focused on our business and our customers," a McDonald's spokesman told us. The company recently dropped Heinz from markets where it was still using the ketchup after the CEO of Burger King left to become the CEO of Heinz.|Nielsen tells us that Burger King spends about one-fourth of what McDonald's spends on advertising, and Burger King tells CNBC that it does not plan to air commercials for the Big King.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/06/troubled-merck-puts-hopes-in-new-hpv-vaccine.aspx|11/06/2013|0|"Merck & Co"|0|Given these statistics, it is not clear if Merck's V503 will have a substantial enough clinical benefit over current HPV vaccines for physicians to justify switching to the new agent. The five additional strains covered by V503 are all cancer-causing "high risk" types, for a cumulative protection against 90% of cervical cancer. Given the variation in prevalence and oncogenicity of the different strains, it is unclear how many cases of cervical cancer would actually be prevented with V503 over Gardasil.|While some analysts estimate annual sales of over $1 billion if V503 is to be approved, these projections are deja vu. Initial estimates during Gardasil's 2006 launch ranged from $4 billion to $10 billion, but in actuality, Merck reported only $1.6 billion in Gardasil sales last year. It should be noted that the estimates for V503 sales would also necessarily come out of otherwise projected Gardasil sales, with the estimated sales of Gardasil projected to be just $525 million by 2018.|As Merck undergoes rounds of layoffs, restructuring, and cost-cutting measures, it is hardly a picture of health. Perhaps most concerning is the declining sales of its diabetes top sellers Januvia and Janumet, both facing strong competition from Johnson & Johnson's recently approved Invokana . Since Invokana's approval in April, Merck has seen its prescriptions decrease while J&J reports strong sales of their new diabetes drug. With struggling sales and strengthening competitors, it seems unlikely that a new Merck HPV vaccine would gain it immunity against deficiencies in other sectors of its business.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/06/which-big-pharma-is-poised-to-see-long-term-gains.aspx|11/06/2013|0|"Merck & Co"|6|This is where investors should be worried, which might sound crazy given the strong performance from its anti-PD-1 and daclatasvir/asunaprevir combination for melanoma and hep-C, respectively. However, another large pharma competitor, Merck (NYSE: MRK) , is not only on the heels of Bristol, but surpassing it in data.|These results sparked optimism among investors, giving hope that its anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) could be used to treat several cancers, including a combination with many of its drugs such as Yervoy. However, Merck reported data on its anti-PD-1 at the same conference, producing an average response rate of 38% and 51% at its best dose. Clearly, this trumps the performance of Bristol.|Then, looking at Bristol's data in treating hep-C, the company recently cured 84.7% of 222 patients in a 24 week phase 3 study using daclatasvir and asunaprevir. Also, very impressive results, but Merck's combination treatment using MK-5172 and MK-8742 in a 65 patient trial cured 100% of patients after just 12 weeks.|Possibly, failing to meet expectationsNow, just for the record, there is a big difference between a 12-week and a 24-week study and in the number of patients. But at the surface, Merck looks to be winning this race as well. Cancer and hep-C are two multibillion-dollar industries that many investors believe Bristol is at the forefront in controlling. Yet, in the end, the best drug will be the most successful commercially, and Bristol doesn't look to have the best drugs.|Moreover, Yervoy's $238 million and 33% year-over-year growth was impressive in Bristol's last quarter, and many believe that Yervoy will be important as the company combines its anti-PD-1 to treat melanoma. However, Merck is also combining its anti-PD-1 to treat melanoma, which is a more effective drug, meaning that it's possible Merck's drug could actually hurt the growth of Yervoy when it comes to the market. Overall, these big catalysts that have Bristol trading higher might never yield the fundamental impact that's expected.|For example, Gilead's valuation is largely tied to its pipeline and excitement for its HCV drug sofosbuvir. The drug recently received a 15-0 vote in favor of FDA approval, with words such as "game changer" often spoke. The drug also worked well in the treatment of HCV in patients with certain STDs, a favorable safety profile with a shorter treatment duration that is all-oral. Currently, analysts project peak sales of $5 billion for the drug. But after Merck's strong results, some actually believe it could challenge Gilead. Hence, Gilead might have to split peak sales on its blockbuster -- a drug expected to increase total sales by 50% -- which is something its stock is not prepared to encounter.|Final thoughtsUnfortunately, stock performance is not always a good indication of risk, nor is the pricing premium placed on companies. Looking throughout the health care space, Merck might have the best overall data combined with the cheapest stock price, at 13 times next years earnings and three times sales. While the company's growth is currently nonexistent, if we look at its pipeline, it's highly likely that the next five years could be positive for the stock.

However, when growth is incorporated into the valuation, SodaStream looks undervalued. Its price-earnings-growth valuation of 0.81 is lower than much bigger peers PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) . While PepsiCo is valued at 2.46 times its PEG, the PEG ratio of Coca-Cola is the highest among the three at 2.60.|Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are the two biggest global players in the carbonated soft drink market with 42% and 28.1% market share, respectively. Because of their well-established positions, the soft drink businesses of those two companies could be considered stable, but they do not offer as much growth as SodaStream.|In the third quarter, PepsiCo's beverage volume rose by 1%, driven by 4% volume growth in its international beverage business. Worldwide sparkling beverage volume for Coca-Cola increased by 1% in the third quarter. Coca-Cola remains a great global brand with 2% volume growth, which helped the company achieve 181 billion servings in the same period.|Foolish takeawayIf investors prefer a stable large business with an increasing dividend stream, they might consider both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. At current prices, while PepsiCo provides investors with a 2.70% dividend yield, the dividend yield of Coca-Cola is a bit higher at 2.80%. SodaStream has not paid any dividends at all.

At the same time, these two soda giants are among the most popular and respected dividend growth companies in the market, so let's take a look at the Coke vs. Pepsi debate from an investor's perspective.|Sodas vs. snacks When it comes to the cola wars, Coca-Cola has already won that competition a long time ago. Regular Coke has long been the market share leader and since 2010 Diet Coke is the second most sold soda brand in the U.S., relegating Pepsi to the third position.|Financial performance While PepsiCo has outgrown Coca-Cola in terms of revenue over the last five years, Coke is doing better than its rival when it comes to earnings-per-share growth over the same period.|Coca-Cola has also done better than PepsiCo in terms of reducing share count via stock buybacks; the company has reduced the amount of shares outstanding by 4.6% over the last five years while Pepsi has not managed to reduce its share count by more than 1.3% over that period.|Sparkling dividends Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are Dividend Aristocrats, meaning they have been able to increase dividends over the last 25 consecutive years. Coke has an amazing track record of 51 consecutive dividend increases in a row, while Pepsi has a smaller but still impressive trajectory of 41 consecutive dividend increases.|And the winner is... Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have earned their rights to be among the most popular dividend growth names in the market due to their rock-solid competitive strengths and time-tested dividend growth trajectories.

That's why food and beverage players like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) have been investing heavily to expand their businesses in the Chinese market.|Ongoing business expansion in ChinaCoca-Cola, the global carbonated soft drink maker, recently opened its 43rd plant in China and its first plant in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. This bottling plant cost around $106 million in invested capital and handles both sparkling and still beverage lines, which include Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite. More production lines will be added in the next several years to serve the growing rate of consumption.|According to chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent, China was the "third-largest global market, growing at double-digits." Thus, Coca-Cola has committed around $4 billion to this market in the three-year period of 2012-2014. This plant is part of this investment plan. More investment will go towards the expansion of facilities and distribution and the development of new beverage products. The company decided that it would not pursue growth via acquisitions because it sees a lot of potential for organic growth in this market.|In the period of 2012-2020, Coca-Cola expects non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry volume to experience 10% compounded annual growth, as the global middle class population increases by 325 million people. In the third quarter, Coca-Cola managed to deliver 9% volume growth in the quarter, driven by a 8% rise in sparkling beverages. The good growth in China was supported by the company's popular "Share a Coke" marketing campaign. Looking forward, Coca-Cola pinpointed four main strategic actions in China: revitalization into sparkling business, provincial segmentation, expansion into adjacent categories, and realignment of the route-to-market.|My Foolish bottom lineChina is still an extremely fertile marketplace for all consumer goods companies. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Mondelez have well-established positions, good economies of scale, strategic partnerships, and strong brand awareness. They could all grow much larger in the Chinese market over the long run.

Humana, the second-largest insurer by subscription in the country behind UnitedHealth, posted a strong third-quarter earnings report today that showed a 7% year-over-year gain in consolidated revenue. Humana's stock has jumped 2% today, and most of the insurance industry's biggest names have followed it up into the green.|It's a good sign for UnitedHealth investors who have grown nervous about the future course of the industry, especially after UnitedHealth posted rather mediocre third-quarter results of its own. UnitedHealth's revenue continues to grow, but the company's membership growth -- a key buffer against the rising costs predicted to come through Obamacare's launch this quarter and next year -- slowed in the third quarter.|Speaking of Obamacare, the Department of Health and Human Services isn't shying away from doubling down on this act's future. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius today said to Congress that a delay of Obamacare is "not an option." Humana, meanwhile, also said today that it expects Obamacare's window of enrollment to be extended due to the HealthCare.gov website's many glitches and problems. An extension could certainly help bring in more customers for insurers, but will it help UnitedHealth in 2014?|Initial enrollment numbers are thought to be low since the exchanges opened up for new insurance customers a little more than a month ago, but UnitedHealth and other major insurers continue to deal with a murky future concerning this law as Capitol Hill wrangles over its fate. A clearer picture would help settle insurance companies' outlooks, and if Sebelius' words are true, than UnitedHealth and other top insurers can better prepare for 2014.|UnitedHealth has taken a cautious approach to the new law by inching into only a handful of states' individual insurance markets for the new exchanges, a decision that may cost it some Americans looking for insurance but should keep projected cost increases down -- especially if younger, healthier Americans don't sign up for the law in the numbers projected. A larger number of sicker and elderly new customers would mitigate the benefits of signing up new customers by driving up medical costs, which have already been increasing lately for the company. UnitedHealth's medical costs jumped nearly 12% over the first half of 2013, outpacing a strong gain in premium revenue.|So long as UnitedHealth can get a handle on costs and keep premiums bringing in cash, it'll be on pace to succeed in 2014. Moving cautiously into Obamacare's first year looks like a safe and smart strategy for this top insurer -- and its investors.

Boeing is 0.5% higher today while the aerospace giant is in negotiations with its largest union regarding where the 777X jetliner will be built. Talks between Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which includes more than 32,000 employees, have accelerated and are at a critical stage this week. The state of Washington hopes to keep assembly of the 777X within its borders, although Boeing gave no mention of using engineers there.|This is an important development for investors to watch, because the two sides have a bumpy past that has involved numerous strikes. The last thing any investor wants is for production on a pivotal aircraft to be postponed, especially after Boeing's 787 Dreamliner turned into a nightmare of budget overruns and production delays.

Just two weeks ago, Boeing added five 747s, six 777s, 65 more 737sand one Dreamliner to the list, for a grand total of:|This is obviously a huge lift to the order book for Boeing, which recently announced plans to boost production of the 737, its most popular plane, from 38 to 42 per month during 2014, with intentions of increasing that number to 47 by 2017.|More potential future upside for Boeing includes the recent landing of a $99.6 million contract for the P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy, as well as two contracts Boeing is currently aiming to secure worth an estimated $85 billion.|Even better news comes from the recent announcement that the 737 MAX, one of the company's aircraft, has confirmed additional fuel efficiency upgrades, totaling a 14% improvement. A representative from Boeing confirmed that the "recent fuel-efficient gain will widen the performance gap in the single-aisle market," further asserting the 737 MAX's spot atop the market in terms of value and fuel efficiency. Boeing has also improved technical specs of the planes to minimize maintenance downtime.|Want more good news? It would be a safe bet to look for Boeing's dividend to increase sometime in the near future. Its current yield of 1.5% trails the market average -- not that there is room to complain, given the stock's outstanding performance year to date. When Boeing set the dividend, it was about a 2.5% yield.|However, Boeing has increased its dividend two years in a row, and, with all of these contracts piling up, it's a safe bet the streak will continue. However, you should have reasonable expectations: Throughout its history, Boeing has been relatively conservative with its dividend. Expect a modest raise, potentially back to where it was before the 70% rise in price.|Foolish bottom lineRecent contract wins, increased orders, and model modifications bode well for the company for the years to come. And we're not just talking about this year and the next, but for years to come as airlines try to modernize their fleets. Boeing looks poised for success, watch for it to continue the trend of dividend increases as a result of its outstanding performance.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/05/a-newer-plane-takes-to-the-skies-for-delta.aspx|11/05/2013|0|"Boeing"|4|For Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) , a recent theme has been "out with the old, in with the not-quite-so-old." Delta has been willing to buy new airplanes when it needs them and the price is right; indeed, Boeing (NYSE: BA) recently delivered the first of 100 737-900ERs to Delta. However, Delta has been equally enthusiastic about finding great deals on used planes that have plenty of life left.|Late last month, Delta's newest "reclamation project" -- the Boeing 717 -- finally took flight for the company. By the end of 2015, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) will have turned over its entire fleet of 88 Boeing 717s to Delta. The 717 is likely to become a workhorse of the Delta fleet for the next 10-15 years, particularly for shorter flights.|A great airplane that didn't fit inWhile the 717 carries the Boeing name, it was originally designed by McDonnell Douglas and marketed as the MD-95. (McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing before the plane went into service, leading to the name change.) The 717 was meant as a replacement option for the popular DC-9, a small narrowbody plane that typically had 100-130 seats, depending on the variant. The 717 is a stunning 24% more fuel efficient than the DC-9.|However, over time, the evolution of the airline business has led airline executives to prefer larger aircraft. Furthermore, Boeing and Airbus both offer aircraft families that cover the whole range of narrowbody sizes (roughly 100 seats to 200 seats). By flying planes from the same aircraft family, an airline can save on crew training and maintenance costs while still enjoying the benefits of using different-sized aircraft for different markets.|These factors conspired to undermine sales of the Boeing 717: only 156 were ever delivered. (For comparison, that would represent just four months of Boeing 737 production!) However, the few customers that did order the 717, including Southwest subsidiary AirTran and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ: HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines, have praised its performance. AirTran, which was the 717's launch customer, found that the fuel savings and reliability exceeded its initial expectations.|A natural fitDelta and the Boeing 717 are a natural fit for each other. First, Delta still has a small fleet of 16 DC-9s that are roughly 35 years old. The rapid arrival of 717s will allow Delta to retire all of these dated aircraft by early January, taking advantage of the 717's 24% better fuel efficiency. While Delta's 717s may not be "new", on average they are more than 20 years younger than the DC-9s they are replacing.|Delta has finally started flying the Boeing 717. Photo: Delta Air Lines.|Another wave of small regional jets operated by Delta's partners are likely to be retired in 2014 and 2015 as well. The Boeing 717 is much cheaper to operate on a per-seat basis, and Delta is betting that travelers will appreciate amenities such as large overhead bins, first-class cabins, and higher ceilings. This should more than make up for the reduction in flight options that results from using larger planes.|Ready for takeoff?Delta wisely jumped on the opportunity to acquire AirTran's fleet of Boeing 717s. While Southwest did not want to integrate the 717s into its own fleet of 737s, Delta is well equipped to handle the complexity of operating many different aircraft types. Delta is leasing the 717s at a very good price, and they will be much cheaper to operate than the aircraft they are replacing.|This statement is quite true and why Southwest is getting rid of the planes. Why? Convientently overlooked by this article, the biggest (and most costly) negative about these plans is that the training will be unique at Delta. They are not the same cockpit as the MD-80 or DC-9 (which are also different from each other). Unlike Boeing and Airbus which strives for the same cockpit and fly-by-wire cabins for their fleet of offeriings, McDonnell Douglas was more of a "one-off" offering with each generation. The only plane that is somewhat close (and still not the same) is the MD-90 which Delta has only a few of (and are trying to get more of those used as well).|My main point was that Delta is the best positioned of any carrier to take advantage of this airplane. Delta already operates just about every aircraft type out there, and has staffing procedures to handle that complexity. For instance, Delta has 18 Boeing 777s, even though it also has similarly-sized A330s and slightly smaller 767-400s in its fleet.|The 717 was originally built by McDonnel-Douglas and therefore, yes, is a spawn of the MD-80 series. There are quite a few of the MD-80 series still reliably flying, though some, not profitable. Boeing inherited this plane when it bought McDonnel-Douglas|The 717 also has the greatest cargo/baggage capacity for it's class of aircraft. This is what it made it very popular with Hawaiian, for flying those luggage-laden tourist and cargo inter-island flights. Also, FYI... Boeing did not buy McDonnell Douglas. It was a stock-for-stock merger transaction. The new merged company decided to retain the Boeing name only (versus dealing with a Boeing-McDonnell acronym), which often leads people to think it was a buyout.

Shares are up 14.8% year to date as of the close of trading on Monday.|TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Cisco Systems as a buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and attractive valuation levels. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.

Or rather, they already unveiled the facts behind today's drop when they reported earnings over the last couple of weeks. The final catalyst comes from much smaller competitor T-Mobile US (NYSE: TMUS) , which reported third-quarter results this morning -- and managed to outshine its larger American rivals for once.|T-Mobile added 1 million subscribers in the third quarter, including 650,000 of the high-margin postpaid variety. By comparison, Verizon added 927,000 postpaid customers but only 481,000 postpaid phone contracts, and AT&T signed up just 363,000 new postpaid subscribers overall.|Moreover, T-Mobile seems to be stealing some of the juiciest customers available: 88% of T-Mobile's phone sales were smartphones, compared to 67% for Verizon. AT&T is holding its own with an 89% smartphone sell-through penetration.|So T-Mobile isn't exactly kicking butt and taking names indiscriminately.

The bull's-eye retailer unveiled its "My Kind of Holiday" campaign in the Great White North this week, which encourages shoppers to share their festive traditions online using the hashtag #MyKindOfHoliday.|Nevertheless, Wal-Mart stores still far outnumber Target locations in the region. Wal-Mart opened its first retail outlets in Canada in 1994 and has since grown to include 380 stores today. Despite Target's smaller footprint, the retailer is betting on its diverse product mix and exclusive offerings to resonate with the Canadian market this season.|To better compete with rival Wal-Mart in the region, Target will offer extended store hours at most Target locations throughout Canada from Nov. 29 through Dec. 30. Target also launched the Canadian version of its Holiday Kids Catalogue, which features more than 250 of this year's most popular toys, electronics, and one-of-a-kind gifts that customers will only find at Target.|'Tis the season to spend Target reports third-quarter earnings at the end of the month, but don't expect holiday sales figures just yet. For that we'll have to wait until the retailer reports fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 full-year results. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see how Target fares in a Canadian market that is currently dominated by Wal-Mart. The National Retail Federation now estimates that holiday retail sales will top $602 billion this year. Moreover, holiday sales can account for as much as 40% of annual revenue for some retailers.

SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY) is teaming up with Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) to reduce its carbon footprint and energy costs, but Wal-Mart is going about it the right way. J.C.

SolarCity offers solar panels to customers like Wal-Mart with no upfront payment. SolarCity maintains ownership of the solar panels and sells the electricity generated back to customers like Wal-Mart at a discount compared to conventional energy. This allows energy and cost reduction goals to be met without using up precious resources.|Wal-Mart is highly profitable but it has its own pile of debt and interest expenses to deal with, so the move is smart on its part.

Like most other providers of video, Internet, and voice service -- including Time Warner Cable and AT&T (NYSE: T) -- Comcast tries to get customers to subscribe to two or three different services, rather than just one.|Video turnaround?Comcast's management team does not believe the situation is quite that bad. On the company's conference call last week, multiple executives attributed the loss of video subscribers to an increase in competition: particularly from AT&T. AT&T has been aggressively growing the number of locations eligible for its "U-Verse" service as part of its Project VIP. AT&T plans to expand U-Verse availability by 8.5 million customer locations between 2013 and 2015 .|Comcast executives described a "tale of two cities": the company is gaining video subscribers in many markets, but losing subscribers in areas where AT&T (or another competitor) has recently entered. However, the company expects to stabilize its losses and even win back customers in areas where it is currently losing share to AT&T .|Given that AT&T is only one year into its U-Verse expansion, Comcast needs to start winning back video customers soon. The first step will be to end the recent run of video subscriber losses. This is the most important metric for shareholders to track; if the video subscriber base continues to erode, it will quickly undermine growth in Internet and voice service.

Supermajors like Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) have similar business structures and equally impressive operational reach that extends across the globe, but their results indicate differences in their performance.|You might be questioning whether you should give Chevron and ExxonMobil the benefit of the doubt and ride out the storms. While Chevron and Exxon are still immensely profitable, well-run businesses, the headwinds facing downstream profits can't be ignored. As a result, while you might stick with Chevron or Exxon, here's why a better candidate may exist among big oil.|One major headwind going forwardThe one huge weight dragging down big oil profits continues to be downstream, and more specifically, refining activities. There's simply no way to get around the fact that as long as spreads continue to contract, margins will continue to compress, and downstream profits will suffer. That being said, Chevron deserves credit for navigating the tough downstream climate better than some of its rivals.|Chevron's U.S. and international downstream segments generated $380 million in earnings, down 55% from $689 million in the same quarter last year. By comparison, ExxonMobil's downstream earnings fell a whopping 81% in its most-recent quarter, year over year.|In all, Chevron's net income clocked in at $5 billion in the quarter, down nearly 6% from the same period last year. Boosting Chevron's bottom line continues to be solid upstream results, driven by increased production. Furthermore, project ramp-ups in the United States, Nigeria, and Angola will serve as a catalyst for further growth in the company's upstream segment.|While falling profits should rarely be celebrated, Chevron is holding up much better than its closest U.S. peer, ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil's quarterly profit fell 18%, primarily because it leans on refining to a larger extent than Chevron.|Should you endure the muddle-through period?It's no secret that integrated energy majors are suffering due to the intense downward pressure on refining activities. Upstream operations continue to perform well for Chevron and ExxonMobil, but there's only so much these companies can do when their downstream activities are posting huge profit decreases.|If you stick with Chevron and ExxonMobil, you'll continue to receive healthy dividends that beat the yield of the broader market. Whereas the S&P 500 pays about 2% and a 10-year Treasury Bond yields just 2.6%, Chevron and ExxonMobil pay 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Of course, if dividends are what you're after, ConocoPhillips beats them all, with a 3.8% payout.|Final thoughtsAs a result, while Chevron and ExxonMobil are two highly profitable blue-chips, there's no escaping an extremely poor refining environment. They're both going to emerge from these tough times unscathed, but when is uncertain. For the time being, ConocoPhillips provides shelter against refining dragging down profits. And, Conoco offers a higher dividend than either Chevron or ExxonMobil and, consequently, may be the best choice among the three.

Wearable technology could go as far as replacing smartphones in the long run. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) are already in the game, promoting smart glasses and watches. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , which designs networking and communications technology, could also benefit enormously, as wearable tech devices will need to be connected to the Internet. How can the retail investor benefit from this tech shift?|Cisco will benefit from increasing demand for connectivityIt's not only manufacturers of wearable technology that will benefit from this tech shift. Companies like Cisco, which provides integrated networking solutions to corporations, could benefit from an increasing demand for connectivity.

Specifically, here are two notes of particular importance.|Refining is extremely weak, but (slightly) improvingIn all, Exxon's quarterly profit fell by $1.7 billion year over year, to $7.8 billion. Exxon performed well in certain segments, including its upstream operations, thanks to higher volumes and lower exploration costs. Unfortunately, downstream earnings continue to collapse due to an extremely harsh environment for refining.|As a result, investors and analysts alike were eagerly awaiting any signal that Exxon's refining may turn a corner. And, while refining results were still very poor, there are at least noticeable signs of improvement.|In total, Exxon's downstream business, which includes refining activities, generated $592 million in earnings during the third quarter. That compares to $3.2 billion in earnings from the downstream segment in the same quarter last year, representing a $2.6 billion drop in downstream profitability year over year.|At the same time, Exxon did show sequential improvements in its downstream operations. Downstream earnings increased by $196 million in the third quarter from the second quarter, driven mostly by lower planned maintenance costs. If you're looking for a silver lining, you can at least say that progress was seen from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, so the trend is getting better.|Weak profits mean less cash for buybacksA critical piece of ExxonMobil's capital allocation is its share repurchasing program. As many investors have noticed, Exxon carries a significantly lower dividend yield than many of its peers, at about 2.9%. Royal Dutch Shell, for all its woes, pays investors a hefty 5% dividend yield. Even BP (NYSE: BP) , still grappling with tens of billions in damages stemming from the Gulf of Mexico spill, offers a 5% yield and recently upped its dividend.|The disparity between Exxon's payout and the dividends of other integrated energy majors, especially matters when times are tough, as they are now. Exxon's shares have languished as its profits took a hit and are actually down over the past year. As a result, investors aren't seeing tangible benefits from Exxon's aggressive share repurchases. And, as profit declines, so too does the amount of cash available for further buybacks.|Keep in mind that Exxon repurchased $5 billion of its shares in the first quarter, and up until then had bought back at least $5 billion of its own stock for the previous ten quarters in a row. Exxon then reduced its buybacks to $4 billion in the second quarter, and repurchases declined again to $3 billion in the third quarter. Furthermore, Exxon projects fourth-quarter buybacks to total $3 billion as well. It's not a surprise that buybacks are slowing given the tough operating environment, but it's a bad sign nonetheless.|Of course, it's only fair to mention that Royal Dutch Shell and BP also buy back shares, just not to the extent of ExxonMobil. Royal Dutch Shell spent $1.5 billion on repurchasing its own shares in the most-recent quarter, and BP bought back $2.9 billion of its stock through the first two fiscal quarters.|Foolish final wordsAs a result, while production difficulties and poor refining results continue to put a damper on all the integrated majors, investors may find BP and Royal Dutch Shell to be better places to park their cash than ExxonMobil. BP and Royal Dutch Shell, and their 5% dividend yields, may prove more attractive in an environment where ExxonMobil's buybacks aren't increasing the stocks price.

While Merck (NYSE: MRK) has jumped 1.2% to rank among the Dow's top leaders, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has fallen to the bottom of the pack, losing 0.6% so far. Let's catch up on what you need to know.|A bright spot for Merck?Merck brought in a wave of good news this past weekend for investors concerned about the company's sluggish response to the patent cliff's impact on its sales and earnings. The company reported solid interim phase 3 trial results from its developmental hepatitis-C virus drugs MK-5172 and MK-8742, both of which scored cure rates nearing 100% in patient groups.|Merck still trails the leaders in the race to develop an all-oral hepatitis C therapy. This market has caught on with firms ranging from big pharma's biggest names to biotechs small and large, as some analysts have projected that the oral hep-C market could be as large as $20 billion. Rivals GileadSciences and AbbVie are leading the pack here, but analysts think Merck's two hepatitis-C drugs in development could be big hits of their own if they record more strong data in the future. It's a good sign for a company whose research and development division has been slammed for its high costs and lackluster results, which led recently to a big shakeup in the business.|That wasn't the only good news for Merck, however. The company's developmental HPV vaccine V503 showed that it might provide stronger prevention against the virus than the company's currently offered HPV vaccine, Gardasil. Gardasil has done well in recent quarters, but some analysts are hopeful that V503 could one day become a blockbuster if it continues on its path. If so, Merck could be on the way to locking down the HPV market.|It's been good news for Merck investors, but Johnson & Johnson shareholders aren't feeling the same love today. The company and its subsidiaries agreed to pay out $2.2 billion to settle accusations of promoting three off-brand non-FDA-approved prescription drugs. The government's criminal and civil allegations included Johnson & Johnson's alleged promotion of antipsychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega, along with heart failure therapy Natrecor.

While it is not yet a global threat to Nike, the potential for Under Armour to grow internationally is massive.|The Nike comparisonThese results compare favorably to Nike's most-recent earnings report. On a year-over-year basis, Nike reported solid revenue growth of 8% and robust earnings-per-share growth of 37% in its most-recent quarter. The company's future orders were also up, and indicate that more strength is likely to continue.|However, analyst estimates call for Under Armour to grow revenue 22% and EPS 24.3% next year, while Nike is expected to grow revenue just 8.7% and EPS 16.1%. Also, simply by taking a look at the revenue for both companies, it is easy to see that Nike has a much larger footprint than Under Armour, which is both a good and bad thing. It means Nike is more diverse and less dependent on individual markets. It also means Nike is not capable of expanding in the same aggressive way that Under Armour can.|ConclusionUnder Armour and Nike recently reported solid performance, which indicates the athletic apparel/footwear space is generally strong. You should be able to do well with either company, although Under Armour is definitely where the aggressive growth is at. Aside from valuation concerns, and a frothy market, there is no reason why Under Armour should be down after reporting such a strong quarter. As such, you should consider the stock, despite its current weakness.|I'm long and I bought more shares at 79. This weakness is based on a "sell on the news" tendency of most investors, coupled with sales of shares by insiders, which I don't view as out of the ordinary. I tend to buy on weakness. The coming retail season should validate my decision as athletic wear (esp. UA and Nike) will be a hot category no matter how strong or weak retail sales are, in general.

However, despite its maturity, it keeps growing. That growth is expected to continue in a big way. For instance, Nike expects fiscal year 2017 revenue to be $36 billion (fiscal year 2012 revenue was $25 billion). Not many mature companies can grow their top line at such a pace. Nike points to strength in apparel, women's, e-commerce, emerging markets, and innovation as drivers of this growth. The Nike+ FuelBand is one example of such innovation, and Nike has just raised the bar.|Nike+ FuelBand SEThe Nike+ FuelBand SE, which will be launced Nov. 6, is an enhanced version of the Nike+ FuelBand that was launched in February 2012. The following isn't a plug for Nike. I don't own any shares of any individual stocks because I don't want readers to see my opinions as biased. That said, I think Nike is one of the best-run companies in the world. The features for any product are important because they will give you an indication of how interested consumers might be in that product.

The earlier version of the FuelBand helped lead Nike's Equipment division to an 18% increase on the bottom line over 2011. Nike is expanding sales from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to France, Germany, and Japan with the Nike+ FuelBand SE.|Still early in the innovation gameSales of Nike+ FuelBands might not have a significant impact on the top line right now. It's more about winning new customers and keeping them loyal to the brand. Nike intends to build on its innovative technologies, which could lead to these types of devices having more of an impact on the top line in the future -- especially if Nike can retain existing customers.|Under Armour (NYSE: UA) has competing products with its Armour39 Module & Chest Strap and Armour39 Watch, but Under Armour is well behind in this area. By having a lead, Nike has an opportunity to accumulate new customers and keep them before Under Armour has a chance to win their loyalty.|The bottom lineNike has the lead in wearable activity trackers.

At $81.10 per share, Under Armour is worth around $8.56 billion on the market. The market values the business at as much as nearly 28.2 times its EV/EBITDA, or enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Much bigger peers Adidas (NASDAQOTH: ADDYY) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) have much lower valuations. Adidas is the cheapest at only 13.3 times its EV/EBITDA, while the EBITDA multiple of Nike is 15.7.|Like Under Armour, Nike also raised average selling prices around the world, which was supported by strengthening its premium segments. The higher selling prices have helped improve its gross margin. For the fiscal year, Nike expects gross margin to increase by around 50 basis points, offset by FX headwinds and labor cost inflation. With the leading position in the market, Nike could drive future growth with product innovations and gross margin expansion.|Adidas, global head-to-head competitor to Nike, could also bring price increases to the market driven by its innovative products. The company thinks that because of its strong innovation and high demand, consumers are ready to pay premium prices. In the first half of this year, Adidas' gross margin rose by 2.1 percentage points to 50.1%. This improvement indicated that the company was on track to meet its Route 2015 plan.

Hence, further growth over last year's quarter was a difficult task. However, Nike posted an 8% increase in its revenue and a 36.5% jump in earnings per share, driven by price increases and cost control initiatives.|Nike experienced great demand for its products in both the Nike brand and the Converse brand. Sales for Nike and Converse grew 7% and 16%, respectively, over last year. All kinds of products such as running, soccer, and basketball items witnessed higher sales.|Nike's secret to its success lies in its drive for innovation.

It is struggling with increases in costs of materials and labor, which hurt its margins. Moreover, it could not meet earnings expectations in its recently reported quarter . However, the company plans to focus on its strategies of remodeling its stores and enhancing its online presence in order to boost earnings.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/12092114/1/pfizers-not-losing-its-kingpin-status.html|11/04/2013|0|"Pfizer"|0|Pfizer's Not Losing Its Kingpin Status|NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Another quarter is in the books for drug giant Pfizer(PFE) and it seems management has healed anxieties about the company's ability to innovate and return value back to shareholders following its spinoff of Zoetis(ZTS) earlier this year.|Although the decision to spin off Zoetis was -- in my opinion -- well thought out, the Street's concerns, which emerged amid a reduction in management's revenue forecasts, were not unfounded especially when Pfizer called for a decline in both earnings-per-share and operating income.|Although management did its best to explain the reason for the guidedown, which included contributions from Zoetis, analysts weren't satisfied. But following a better-than-expected third quarter, which beat the consensus estimate, Pfizer has also cured fears of an eroding pipeline. Investors are now debating whether they should buy into this breakout, which the stock has suddenly enjoyed, or calm their nerves for a better entry point.|Not to mention, Pfizer's performance significantly outperformed the likes of GlaxoSmithKline(GSK) and Merck(MRK), the latter of which recently posted 4% revenue decline. And when digging deeper into Pfizer's segmental performance, it was clear that although Pfizer has not fully remedied its near-term growth struggles, let's appreciate that management is executing on its long-term vision.|So with these issues in mind, my growth expectations for Pfizer were tempered, or as I prefer to say, "more realistic" than most. But not only was management able to grow profits by 3% year over year, but Pfizer managed to beat consensus earnings-per-share estimates by 2 cents, while growing EPS by 16% year over year. This is where management's "value core" decision has begun to pay dividends.|But the company is not taking its patent situation lightly. Management said that among its top priorities in the coming quarters is to boost Pfizer's pipeline with cancer-fighting drugs like Palbociclib, which is now in a phase-3 trial and used for patients with advanced recurrent breast cancer. Pfizer is also focused on drugs to treat (among others) type-2 diabetes and cholesterol.|It was not a perfect quarter -- not by any stretch. But the strong sequential and year-over-year improvements should alleviate a great deal of doubt that Pfizer's growth would remain sedated. And although Pfizer's pipeline did reveal more weakness this quarter, don't be fooled into thinking that it is the only one. Both Merck and Johnson & Johnson showed similar symptoms. Even so, Pfizer's management has this business back on track. And with shares trading around $31, I'm modeling for low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next several quarters and a steady climb to $40.

In a study cited by Foodnavigator USA, the decreased consumption of "sugar sweetened beverages" correlated with a drop in cholesterol and "inflammatory biomarkers." The link between these two trends has yet to be established. Beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) sponsored its own study and deeply criticized the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, indicating that claims shouldn't be used in policy decision-making.|Carbonated-beverage companies face an ever-steeper hill while fighting headwinds from the healthy lifestyle movement. Governments seek to give soda the cigarette treatment by imposing an excise tax. The city of San Francisco wants to impose a $0.02 per ounce tax on soda. Even governments outside the U.S. seek to regulate soda consumption. The Mexican government wants to pass an excise tax on soda and junk food much to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent's disdain in its most recent earnings call. India also seeks tougher scrutiny on sodas sold there. As a result of regulations, the soda industry swoops in and spends legal dollars to fight new regulations and risk its public relations image in the process. Moreover, Coke's bottler executives in the Latin America region predict an increase in bottler consolidation to increase economies of scale and combat any friction caused by potential soda regulation.|Rival soda and snack-food giant PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) saw its core volume of carbonated soda beverages decline in the "mid-single digits" during the last quarter in North America. Coca-Cola saw its quarterly carbonated soda volume expand 1% worldwide. However, Coca-Cola's North American soda volume remained even this past quarter versus the same time last year.|New products come into the marketplaceCoca-Cola recently demonstrated a number of new products and means of selling them at the National Association of Convenience Stores Show, according to BevNet. For example, it introduced a new Vitaminwater fountain dispenser that could add to consumer convenience by making it easier to consume the drink. This could give Coca-Cola's Vitaminwater the same ubiquity and scale enjoyed by its carbonated soda brethren. In addition, Coca-Cola introduced Minute Maid Drops to its lineup of liquid water enhancers. Coca-Cola also introduced a can that features a graphic of an ice cube when it gets cold.|PepsiCo recently introduced new products of its own. It expanded its Frito Lay line with the introduction of Stacy's Bake Shop Bakery Crisps. PepsiCo also introduced the new Aquafina FlavorSplash line of flavored water products to meet the consumer need for a combination of a healthier and tasty drink. Coca-Cola one-upped Pepsi by introducing a line of flavored Dasani sparkling bottled waters.|A competitor steps upBeverage World recently named coffee and tea giant Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) "Liquid Refreshment Company of the Year." Last year it bought Teavana, a maker of high-end tea. According to BeverageWorld, Starbucks wants to enter the carbonated soda business. It hopes to compete on the grounds of ingredient transparency and quality. Also, Starbucks wants to expand into the cold-pressed juice market, adding to the competition in the juice space. With Starbucks expanding its restaurant empire and grabbing shelf space in grocery stores, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper may want to pay attention.|Foolish takeawayCoca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper will need to work harder to redefine themselves and stay one step ahead of the competition. Taxes, new competition, and new attitudes surrounding sodas will not make this task easy. In fact, they may want to look at competitors like Starbucks and SodaStream for ideas on how to compete if their own ideas don't measure up.

UnitedHealth added 4.35 million to its member rolls this year. WellPoint's enrollment grew 6% to 35.5 million members thanks to its acquisition of Medicare insurer Amerigroup. And the number of people enrolled in Cigna's global health care division climbed 2.3% from last year.|So far, it appears UnitedHealth, WellPoint, and Cigna are all doing a good job at controlling costs tied to serving these members. The three companies' medical loss ratio, or MLR, are tracking within the Affordable Care Act's mandated 80% to 85% range.|That ratio, which shows how much insurers are spending on patient care relative to how much they're collecting in premium revenue, is particularly strong at UnitedHealth, which posted an MLR of 80.6% in its third quarter. At 84.9%, WellPoint had the highest ratio, and Cigna split the difference at 82.9%.|However, while those ratios are where you would like to see them, you'll want to know if other costs are being kept in line, too. One of my favorite ways to determining this is by comparing operating margins because leaner operations should provide greater earnings leverage. Across these three insurers, UnitedHealth is tops at converting sales into profit, with a trailing 12 month operating margin of 7.77%.|The consistency of those margins, combined with rising revenue from membership growth, and share repurchases, has helped each of the companies grow earnings per share over the past decade. The fastest earnings growth has come from UnitedHealth, which has seen compounded EPS gain an average 16.91% over the past five years. At WellPoint, earnings have grown 8.32%, and at Cigna, they've increased 23.1%. Based on operating margin and earnings growth, it appears that WellPoint comes up short.|WellPoint's trailing margin and earnings results are also reflected in Wall Street analysts' earnings expectations. Analysts expect EPS will fall by 1.3% at WellPoint next year, and increase at both UnitedHealth and Cigna.|UnitedHealth|Debating valuationIt's probably not surprising to see Cigna, which has the highest expected earnings growth for the coming year, trading at the highest price to sales. It's also not a shock to see WellPoint, where earnings are expected to slip, as the least expensive on a P/S basis. UnitedHealth arguably has the most running room based on its 10-year range.|ConclusionThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act is a major concern for the industry, because insurers ability to profit will ultimately be driven by how many members sign up. Assuming those launch headaches dissolve and membership climbs, UnitedHealth, WellPoint, and Cigna should all benefit from rising revenue and stable MLRs. However, it appears investors are already pricing in that growth based on P/E and P/E to growth ratios. Of the three, Cigna appears to have the edge, given its price to growth, and strong earnings outlook.|Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned. Todd owns E.B.

And today, I'm going to dive into three of the most important advantages for American Express -- its:|We've got a little jargon going on here, but fret not, these are easy to understand and key to figuring out American Express's advantages. So, pull out your charge card as we account for how American Express is swiping away the competition.|According to Forbes' list of the most powerful brand names, American Express ranks at 34, with rival Visa just a tad ahead at 29, and MasterCard a bit lower at 52. It's worth mentioning, though, that among financial services companies, Visa, American Express, and MasterCard rank one, two, and four, respectively.|Ultimately, good brands are hard to create and even harder to maintain -- just ask Citigroup and Bank of America. American Express has a truly great brand, and it's hard to imagine that changing.|The circle of lifeFor years, American Express has operated within a "closed loop," which means that the company both issues cards and acquires merchants. This is different than competitors Visa and MasterCard; the cards with those companies' logos are issued by independent bank networks, while merchants are acquired by independent merchant acquirers.|However, the closed-loop operations aren't the rule everywhere for American Express. As an article in Forbes put it, "Almost 80% of American Express branded cards issued outside the U.S. were issued through third party financial institutions."|But wait a second. If the closed-loop system is so advantageous, shouldn't American Express be doing that everywhere? Not so fast. American Express's platform works because of its strong brand awareness. That's an awareness that, frankly, isn't as strong internationally as it is at home. While leveraging international third-party distributors is essential for growing brand recognition, it'll be worth keeping an eye on American Express's long-term strategy surrounding its closed-loop platform in the U.S. and overseas. I like the closed-loop approach, but it's also important for the company to find ways to grow and expand.|Hey! Must be the moneyWhen it comes to credit card companies, there are two main platforms to work from: spend-centric and lend-based. American Express uses a spend-centric approach, or as I like to refer to it, a people-centric approach. The theory is this: If a company charges lower fees, provides very lucrative offers, and generally provides a great customer experience, you'll have a card people -- particularly higher-income groups -- want to use and it therefore provides leverage over merchants.|Put it on my tabAmerican Express has built a strong brand name, a system for controlling customer risk, and gaining insight into customer preferences while creating a card that people genuinely want to use.

Although Chevron is locked strictly into the oil and gas industry, it has exploration and production assets around the globe, across a number of asset sources (natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil), and has refining capabilities as well. Although we see oil prices fluctuate which can have a negative impact on Chevron E&P business, lower oil prices can possibly boost refining demand and even crack spreads, helping to balance out a lot of Chevron's downside risk. Also, like the others listed here, Chevron is a dividend aristocrat, having raised its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years, which is often enough to chase away pessimists who question the durability of its business model.|If you read too much into Chevron's third-quarter report, then investors definitely might worry a bit. While Chevron's E&P business was solid, a deterioration in its refining and marketing business caused it to fall well short of Wall Street's profit estimates for the quarter. What investors are ignoring, though, are Chevron's immense offshore assets which is where much of the future value of this company is tied. Chevron can actually offer a quicker growth rate and better dividend yield than many of its peers over the coming decade, which is why I selected it to my Basic Needs Portfolio earlier this year.|The Motley Fool owns shares of, and recommends, Berkshire Hathaway.

They add thicker meat where judges like it most, between the 12th and 13th ribs, where rib-eye steaks come from.|Merck temporarily suspended Zilmax sales in the United States and Canada in August, soon after the largest U.S. meat processor, Tyson Foods Inc, stopped accepting Zilmax-fed cattle for slaughter over animal welfare concerns. After Merck last week said it was preparing to return Zilmax to the market, giant food company Cargill Inc declared it would bar Zilmax-fed animals from its supply chain until it was "100 percent confident" those issues are resolved.|But in cattle shows at state and county fairs across the farm belt, Zilmax remains popular. Despite the halt in sales of Merck's zilpaterol - Zilmax is the trade name - existing stockpiles of Zilmax-based show feeds circulated at fairs this fall. So, too, did products made with Optaflexx, a rival drug by Eli Lilly & Co's Elanco Animal Health group that is based on ractopamine, also a beta-agonist.|For drug giant Merck, the show-feed market is a tiny slice of Zilmax's U.S. sales, roughly $160 million last year.

Its product innovation goals are to make athletes stronger, faster, and help them achieve new performance levels.|In the first quarter of fiscal 2014 the next generation of Flyknit, the Nike Free Flyknit, was introduced to the market.

In the sportswear category, the Nike Tech Pack new line of premium apparel was launched. The Tech Pack is designed to improve fit, comfort, and breathability for the consumer and it is expected to be a big growth driver for Nike's sportswear category in the future.

Lafley earlier this year and P&G's push into emerging markets where growth rates are much more robust than in the U.S., I don't think current shareholders have much to fear. Procter & Gamble's third-quarter results delivered revenue growth of 2.2% which topped estimates by roughly $160 million while profit topped the Street's forecast by $0.01.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Coca- Cola owns, licenses and markets more than 500 beverage brands, and serves more than 1.7 billion consumers every day in more than 200 countries or territories. The company has diversified its products portfolio through various major acquisitions like Minute Maid in 1960, Indian cola brand Thums Up in 1993 and Barq's in 1995. Coke's story is all about a triumph of marketing during the consumerization of America -- when you identify Santa Claus and polar bears with a fizzy drink, you know someone's done a good job with their branding.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)Anheuser-Busch InBev has been paying yearly dividends since 2010, following its merger, but that doesn't accurately capture the company's streak -- Anheuser-Busch held a 31-year streak of dividend increases prior to its merger. However, a lack of earlier data makes this is an easy win for Coca-Cola, particularly considering when it began paying dividends. Coke has paid uninterrupted dividends each quarter for more than nine decades, since 1920 -- one year after the passage of Prohibition in the United States. It's probably reasonably safe to assume that Anheuser-Busch was more concerned with staying afloat than paying back its shareholders during those years.|Winner: Coca-Cola, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Anheuser-Busch InBev was created in the summer of 2009 and has increased its payouts at least once every year since it began paying dividends in 2010. Combine that with its 31-year streak before its merger and you get 35 years of consecutive growth. However, Coke has been increasing its dividend at least once per year since 1963, according to dividend.com. A 50-year streak of dividend raises lets Coca-Cola win the stability crown without breaking a sweat.|Winner: Coca-Cola, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Coca-Cola may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Coca-Cola has a better shot at long-term outperformance, thanks to its diversified portfolio, strong brand recognition, and ability to adjust to new consumer taste preferences -- but growing health concerns may pose threat to its legendary soft drink business. Anheuser-Busch InBev's active acquisition strategy has been its primary growth engine in recent years, and there isn't a lot more space to enter in what seems to be a fully matured global beer market. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others. Keep your eyes open -- you never know where you might find the next great dividend stock!

Although macroeconomic factors do still have some bearing on Wal-Mart's underlying results, short-sellers of the world's largest retailer simply don't see much downside traction outside of a moderate recession. Another factor is Wal-Mart's low beta of 0.28, which means it's only 28% as volatile as the broad-based S&P 500. Short-sellers are typically after a quick dollar and Wal-Mart's small moves typically don't suit their volatility-seeking needs.|Despite Wal-Mart's status as the nation's largest retailer, there are a few disconcerting signs with the U.S. economy that shareholders should keep their eyes on. Consumer confidence is falling once again which acts as both good and bad news for Wal-Mart. Falling consumer confidence figures tend to draw cost-conscious shoppers into its stores and away from competitors which is good news; but it also makes shoppers hold off on discretionary purchases which is where Wal-Mart would be expected to make its beefiest margins. Wal-Mart hasn't delivered its quarterly report as of yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to once again see a negative same-store sales comparison amid a tough retail environment when it does. While Wal-Mart may have little downside, the upside also appears somewhat limited at present as well.

Instead, AT&T is merely a victim of its own industry. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 19.2% year-to-date, most investors would rather own high growth companies than get stuck in defensive names like AT&T whose stock and business are unlikely to see much benefit in a rapidly advancing market. The thought here for short-sellers is to bet against the stock while this growth rotation is ongoing and presumably make money.|Perhaps a little bit of pessimism is warranted given that it needs to be play catch-up to Verizon with regard to its 4G LTE nationwide rollout, but outside of that aspect AT&T doesn't fit the mold of a stock short-sellers can make a lot, if any, money from. AT&T has a very low beta meaning it tends to move far less than the overall market, is extremely profitable having produced more than $19 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12-month period, and recently topped Wall Street's third-quarter EPS forecast by $0.01. To add, it also delivers one of the more impressive yields within the Dow at 5%. I'd say this has all the makings of a company short-sellers should be actively avoiding!|Not to rinse and repeat, but the story with Verizon is almost identical to that of AT&T as to why short-sellers are betting against it. Verizon's growth rate, thanks to Verizon Wireless, is a bit more robust than AT&T (and likely the reason AT&T has the slightly higher short interest), but it still doesn't have the allure that many high-growth tech companies have. So, like AT&T, short-sellers are pouncing based on the idea of an investing rotation out of defensive stocks and into higher growth names. In addition, there's a slight bit of acquisition related uncertainty surrounding its $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group.|Much like AT&T, perhaps a little bit of upside skepticism should be priced in given its monstrous acquisition, but I wouldn't seriously consider betting against Verizon here with a dividend yield of 4.1% and the nation's broadest 4G LTE coverage which acts as a major selling point for signing up and retaining highly sought after wireless customers. Although its high growth days are long gone, I believe it would take nothing short of a deep recession to put a hurting on Verizon's bottom line.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/02/top-5-defense-contractors-influencing-americas-pol.aspx|11/02/2013|0|"Boeing"|1|So, who are the biggest "givers" when it comes to politicians and the 2013-2014 cycle? By order of generosity, it goes like this: Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) , Lockheed, Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) , Boeing (NYSE: BA) , and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) . Also interesting? In fiscal 2013, the top six defense contractors that were awarded prime contracts by the U.S. Department of Defense were, by order of amount received; Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics (which comes in at No. 6 for being most generous to politicians), Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and United Tech. Further, all of these defense contractors are among the top 10 biggest defense contractors in the world, when it comes to rankings by revenue.|Politics, money, and defense In the world of defense contracting, it pays to be generous. Literally. For example, in the election cycles for 1998-2002, Lockheed was the top defense "giver." In 2001, it was also awarded the insanely expensive F-35 contract. In the 2010 election cycle, Boeing was the top defense giver. In 2011 it was awarded the KC-46 tanker contract. Coincidence? Maybe. However, perhaps it's less surprising that Lockheed and Boeing received two of the biggest contracts ever awarded by the Pentagon, in the same time frame where they were especially generous. Further, Lockheed has stayed in the top of defense "givers" for years. It's also the top defense company.|Who's getting the loot Since 1990, defense contractors have contributed more than $200 million to politicians -- and 57% of that amount went to Republicans. However, before you jump on Republicans for taking defense handouts, consider that in the 2012 election cycle, Boeing's biggest beneficiary was none other than President Obama. More importantly, that's just how things are done in politics -- that's not to say it's right. However, for investors, this is information we can use. Right now, Northrop is the No. 1 defense contributor. I imagine there are also some lucrative contracts up for grabs, and it's greasing the wheels. The same could be said for Lockheed and Raytheon.

Source: Boeing.|Records were made to be brokenAccording to Boeing, Q3 2013 marked its highest-ever backlog, with the company achieving $415 billion worth of orders received from its customers, still waiting to be filled (and converted into revenues). The bulk of this work resides in Boeing's commercial airplanes business, where customers have placed orders for some 4,800 airplanes, amounting to $345 billion in value, or 83% of the total backlog.|By far the biggest bottleneck in Boeing's production line is the company's uber-successful 737 line of regional jet aircraft. With more than 3,400 planes still on order, 737s account for 71% of the company's commercial backlog.|Nice as it is to know that it has all this business "in the bag", though, it does pose a problem for Boeing. At its current 38-planes-per-month rate of production, Boeing is churning out 737s at the rate of 1.7 planes per workday. By any objective measure, that's a fantastically fast pace of production and a feat of production wizardry. Yet it's still too slow.|At its current rate, Boeing would need 89.5 months -- seven-and-a-half years -- to build enough 737s to satisfy all the folks who want to buy them. And that's if it takes in no new orders at all. (In fact, Boeing took in 65 new 737 orders over just the last couple of weeks.)|Use it or lose itNow, seven-and-a-half years is an awful lot of time to expect customers to wait around for their planes. It gives these customers a lot of time to develop buyer's remorse and change their minds about the orders they've placed. Worse, it gives Boeing's competitors -- not just Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) but also up-and-coming regional airplane producers such as Bombardier (NASDAQOTH: BDRAF) , Russia's Superjet, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy, and China's AVIC -- time to poach clients and steal away orders. Indeed, competition from these rivals may have contributed to the fact that over the past 10 months, Boeing lost 131 of its 737 orders to customer cancellation -- more than 14% of orders taken in during the period.|So what's the solution? Clearly, Boeing needs to build planes faster and get these orders filled before they disappear. And, in fact, it's been doing just that. Check out the chart below, which shows how Boeing has announced multiple accelerations in its pace of 737 production over the past few years:|This week, Boeing announced its most recent production rate increase: a plan to up 737 production to 47 planes per month, or about 24% faster than its current pace. Why? Former Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Jim Albaugh went on record a couple years ago, warning that the seven-year long backlog on Boeing's 737 lineup was simply "too big" and needed to be shortened. Instead, the backlog has lengthened by six months.|Foolish takeawayAs "problems" go, Boeing's 737 salesforce being too good at their job selling planes is one of the nicer difficulties the company could have. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Boeing today has even more backlog to work through than it did when Albaugh warned of the too-big backlog problem... two years ago.|The 19-month break in announced production ramps, shown in that chart up above, illustrates the problem quite nicely, I think. For too long, Boeing has "run up the score" on its backlog number, without making the investments in production capacity necessary to ensure it can actually build all the planes it has been selling.|It's time to start investingDo you think Boeing will overcome its problems? Would you love to own the stock, but aren't sure how to invest, or whether it's even safe? Millions of Americans have waited on the sidelines since the market meltdown in 2008 and 2009, too scared to invest and put their money at further risk.

Weak commodity prices and a slowdown in growth from China has crushed demand for heavy-duty mining equipment and caused Caterpillar to lower its guidance not once, not twice, but thrice this year! In Caterpillar's third-quarter results, released last week, it reported an 18% decline in revenue to $13.4 billion as net income slipped nearly 45% to $946 million. Furthermore, Caterpillar lowered its full-year revenue guidance at the midpoint by about $2 billion and lopped $1 in EPS off as well.|Based on the commentary by Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman, who noted via Reuters, "Any expansion in the near term is dead, it's over, it's not going to happen," I'd say that short-sellers are looking pretty good. This is one of those instances where we know Caterpillar has a strong balance sheet and we know it has the product line and market share to succeed when mining growth does rebound. The only problem: we have no clue when that's actually going to happen. At some point Caterpillar is going to get so cheap on a forward earnings basis that value investors will start buying, but we clearly haven't hit that level yet.

The least expensive upfront option is a high-efficiency gas storage water heater. However, it will only reduce the water heating bill by 7%. General Electric (NYSE: GE) , for example, offers an Energy Star qualified model that is about 7.8% more efficient than a standard model.|On the other hand, a whole-home tankless or gas condensing unit could cut water heating bills by 30%. Finally, a heat pump could cut energy usage in half. For example, General Electric's GeoSpring hybrid electric heat pump uses 62% less energy. That could save the average consumer $325 per year. Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) is another company that makes a variety of energy efficient water heaters, including a hybrid electric heat pump that can cut the cost of heating water in half.|AppliancesAs a general rule of thumb, appliances over 10 years old consume twice as much as the current Energy Star appliances on the market today. Both General Electric and Whirlpool offer a variety of Energy Star appliances. For example on the cost savings, the total energy and water savings of a General Electric Energy Star qualified washing machine can pay for the initial cost of the washer over its lifetime.

Among those increased were Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) , Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) , and Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) . Data management software giant Oracle has seen its growth slow in recent years and has made some competitive compromises and partnerships. Shareholders have not been thrilled with CEO Larry Ellison's compensation which is usually in the tens of millions and in 2013 topped $150 million. Oracle is facing significant competition from other tech titans as well as from relative upstarts such as Workday, founded by some folks Ellison dismissed. Oracle has doubled its dividend while announcing big stock buybacks and generating prodigious free cash flow that tops $14 billion annually. The stock seems appealingly valued at recent levels.|Coca-Cola may be huge, with its market cap near $175 billion, but it's still growing, with global volume up 2% in its third quarter. The growing global middle class has the beverage giant optimistic that it can double its revenue in the next seven years. Coca-Cola stock recently yielded 2.8%. Bulls are pleased with recent marketing successes and management's capital priorities. Socially responsible investing enthusiasts are especially pleased with Coke's initiative to provide clean water to global communities in need.|PepsiCo's soft-drink market share of about 28% is far smaller than Coke's 42%, but there's much more to PepsiCo than just beverages. It's a salty-snack giant, you see, with snack sales growing more briskly than drink sales. (Its brands are familiar to almost any American: Frito-Lay, Cheetos, Doritos, etc.) Besides, in overall beverages, PepsiCo actually leads Coca-Cola in retail sales.

AT&T has a very low beta meaning it tends to move far less than the overall market, is extremely profitable having produced more than $19 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12-month period, and recently topped Wall Street's third-quarter EPS forecast by $0.01. To add, it also delivers one of the more impressive yields within the Dow at 5%. I'd say this has all the makings of a company short-sellers should be actively avoiding!|Verizon Why are investors shorting Verizon?|Not to rinse and repeat, but the story with Verizon is almost identical to that of AT&T as to why short-sellers are betting against it. Verizon's growth rate, thanks to Verizon Wireless, is a bit more robust than AT&T (and likely the reason AT&T has the slightly higher short interest), but it still doesn't have the allure that many high-growth tech companies have. So, like AT&T, short-sellers are pouncing based on the idea of an investing rotation out of defensive stocks and into higher growth names. In addition, there's a slight bit of acquisition related uncertainty surrounding its $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group.|Much like AT&T, perhaps a little bit of upside skepticism should be priced in given its monstrous acquisition, but I wouldn't seriously consider betting against Verizon here with a dividend yield of 4.1% and the nation's broadest 4G LTE coverage which acts as a major selling point for signing up and retaining highly sought after wireless customers. Although its high growth days are long gone, I believe it would take nothing short of a deep recession to put a hurting on Verizon's bottom line.

The rationale for acquiring Vodafone is clear: growth. In the U.S. market, AT&T is the No. 2 mobile carrier, but it's losing market share to the No. 1 player, Verizon Wireless, and the No. 3, T-Mobile USA.|With any formal discussions yet to begin, we're some ways from an acquisition deal between AT&T and Vodafone.

As Boeing's order book has climbed substantially in 2013, the company's expansion plans are not only completely justified, but they're necessary for the company to execute on the high demand for its aircraft.

Arkwin manufactures fuel and hydraulic systems for planes (Airbus and Boeing 737) and helicopters. The deal valued Arkwin at 8.7 times TTM EBITDA.|TransDigm's investors raised a lot of hue and cry after news broke that Boeing had launched a new program to partner with its major aircraft parts suppliers, such as TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR) . Boeing intends to partner with its suppliers in helping them redesign their supply chains; in turn, suppliers will charge Boeing lower prices when they renew their contracts.|At a casual glance, Spirit AeroSystems looks set get hurt the most by the Boeing program, since it derives 84% of its revenues from Boeing sales, compared to TransDigm's 13%.|But in my humble opinion, investors really don't have much to worry about, since both TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems have plenty of bargaining power, and is highly unlikely they will be easily arm-twisted by Boeing. As I had pointed out before, TransDigm is the sole supplier of 75% of its products. As far as Boeing is concerned, TransDigm is the sole supplier of close to 100% of the aircraft parts it sells to Boeing.|Spirit AeroSystems, on the other hand, typically signs long-term contracts with Boeing that usually last the entire length of the aircraft programs. When you further consider the lengthy testing and certification period required before any new products from new suppliers can be approved by Boeing, and it would be pretty safe to say that it's going to be an uphill task for Boeing to switch suppliers. The high capital infusion required to build new aircraft parts manufacturing facilities provides another huge entry barrier for interested parties.|Although Boeing itself commands a huge clout on account of its size, its terms will have to be agreeable to both TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems if the deal is to see the light of day.

The oil and gas sector as a whole is down as oil prices fell nearly 2%. The drop is due to stockpiles that continue to rise, as well as a strengthening dollar. As of 1:30 p.m. EDT the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is down two points to 1,754 and the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEMKT: SPY) , is down 0.1%.|Yesterday, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) reported earnings that beat analyst estimates on both earnings and production. Exxon's results were weighed down by the company's refining division where profits dropped 80% year over year. Chevron today is down 2.2% after reporting worse-than-expected earnings with similar problems as Exxon in the refining division.|Chevron warned analysts on Oct. 9 that this quarter's result would be weighed upon by "significantly lower" earnings in its refining business. Analysts didn't decrease their expectations enough as Chevron still surprised them with its earnings. Chevron reported earnings per share of $2.57, down 4% from the year-ago period and worse than analyst expectations of $2.71. Revenue rose 0.8% to $58 billion, less than analyst expectations of $59 billion. Production was up 2.7% year over year to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.|The refining industry as a whole has been struggling with an oversupply of capacity. This weighs on the prices refiners can charge and has been seen in all the majors' results. Chevron's refining operations reported earnings of $380 million, 45% lower than a year ago.

Weaker margins from Chevron's refinery operations contributed to a nearly 6% drop in earnings from the year-ago quarter, but sales rose slightly as production of both oil and natural gas climbed during the quarter. Chevron's long-run prospects remain sound, as the company moves forward with major projects to bring liquefied natural gas from Australia to serve energy-hungry markets throughout Asia. Plans to tap the Gulf of Mexico's deepwater energy riches also represent a big growth driver for Chevron.

Upstream earnings from Chevron's exploration and production businesses fell by almost 1%, with a sharp decline in income from the U.S. side of the segment more than offsetting slight gains internationally. But downstream operations from refining and marketing took a much bigger earnings hit, with net income from the segment dropping 45%. Foreign-currency effects also continued to hold Chevron's earnings down, as the company attributed $276 million in lost earnings to the strong dollar.|On the production side, though, Chevron posted solid gains. Total production rose by 2.7%, with growth coming equally from domestic and international projects. Natural gas production growth outpaced Chevron's overall production growth rate, although the 2.2% gain in oil and liquids production reversed drops earlier in the year on that side of the business.|Chevron CEO John Watson blamed the earnings drop on lower refinery margins but cited "good progress on our major capital projects," including its construction of liquefied-natural-gas plants in Australia and its deepwater efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, as reason for optimism. Watson also pointed to growth opportunities in Chevron's downstream business.|As of 9:10 a.m. EDT, Chevron shares were down about 0.5% in pre-market trading.|Chevron will have a conference call at 11 a.m. EDT to discuss the results in further detail.

The move comes as homebuilder DR Horton lost 2.32% today as concerns pertaining to the housing market begin flaring up again. One reason is because interest rates jumped higher today; the five-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield rose from 1.32%, to 1.37%, while the 10 year increased from 2.54%, to 2.62%, and the 30 year jumped from 3.63%, to 3.7%. As we have seen in the recent past, rising interest rates will temporarily put a damper on the housing market, as possible homebuyers are scared away due to the increased cost of financing.

Just in case you were wondering.|I won't deny the fact that Johnson & Johnson's drug business continues to do most of the pulling, but I am -- nonetheless -- impressed by the meaningful improvements management has made in areas like orthopedics and medical devices.|Leading the way was Johnson & Johnson's best-seller Zytiga, which surged more than 70% year over year. As evident by the 30% sequential growth, it's beginning to look as if management has found a winner in Xarelto. This is JNJ's blood thinner that has begun to threaten Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) top-selling alternative Eliquis.|Not to be outdone, Johnson & Johnson immunology and oncology drug, which was up 13% and have proven very effective among cancer patients, gives the company advantage over Merck and Sanofi(SNY), especially given the inroads JNJ has made in cancer, and now with type-2 diabetes drug Invokana.|Despite the fact that Invokana has been on the market only a few months, it continues to steal existing products share from both Merck and Sanofi -- but that wasn't all good news. For instance, while I'm willing to credit management for advancing Johnson & Johnson's other segments, such as cardiology and surgery, noticeable weaknesses in areas like medical devices and the consumer business still linger.|With non-GAAP earnings climbing more than 11% year over year, easily beating the consensus estimate, it was still a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson. The strong consistent profits are the main reasons why the Street cares very little about "obscure" details like organic growth. That the stock sits close to its 52-week high means that expectations are still lofty for the company.

Shares of Pfizer barely budged after its earnings report, although the stock remains up more than 20% over the past 12 months and currently sits near its 52-week high.|The story of Pfizer is a well known one -- for several years it rode high on the success of Lipitor, its blockbuster cholesterol drug that once had peak sales of $13 billion. When Lipitor's patent expired in 2011, it left a gaping hole.|Pfizer quickly responded by cutting costs, downsizing its operations, and selling and spinning off non-core businesses. As a result, Pfizer preserved its bottom line even as its revenue fell -- an impressive feat that convinced shareholders to stick with the stock, and shares have risen more than 40% over the past two years.|Although Pfizer has proven its ability to preserve its bottom line, it hasn't yet shown that it can grow its sales.|Therefore, let's take a closer look at Pfizer's efforts in oncology, which could be the key to unlocking the company's ability to grow its top line.|Third quarter at a glanceFor its third quarter, Pfizer's earnings rose 16% year over year to $0.58 per share, but its revenue declined 2% to $12.6 billion. Sales fell for the usual reasons -- a 59% year-over-year decline in Lipitor sales, which only came in at $78 million during the quarter, and the termination of collaborations for the respiratory drug Spiriva across several regions.|Source: Pfizer third-quarter earnings report.|The rest of Pfizer's sales growth was mixed, but the 24% growth in its oncology segment stood out above all the rest. Although the oncology segment only accounts for 3% of Pfizer's revenue, there are several rapidly growing products in its oncology portfolio, which could boost the segment's importance over the next few years.|A closer look at Pfizer's oncology segmentPfizer's two fastest growing oncology products are Xalkori and Inlyta. Sales of Xalkori, its treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, rose 92% year over year to $73 million. Sales of Inlyta, a late-stage kidney cancer treatment, rose 186% to $83 million.|However, Inlyta is not the only kidney cancer treatment Pfizer has in its oncology portfolio. Sutent, an older cancer drug approved for rare types of stomach and pancreatic cancer, has also shown promise in clinical trials as a first-line treatment for late-stage kidney cancer. If approved, the competitive field will be fairly narrow -- GlaxoSmithKline's Votrient is the only other major drug currently recommended as a first-line treatment for late-stage kidney cancer.|Sources: Pfizer third-quarter earnings report, industry websites.|How do these drugs fit into Pfizer's future?Of course, Pfizer's oncology portfolio is still a small piece of the puzzle. For these treatments to make a meaningful impact on Pfizer's top line growth, two other non-oncology drugs -- Xeljanz and Eliquis -- must live up to their full potential.|The reasoning is simple -- the market for rheumatoid arthritis treatments is huge, dominated by blockbuster treatments such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Merck's Remicade, AbbVie's Humira, and Enbrel, which Amgen co-markets with Pfizer. On Pfizer's side, Enbrel sales rose 4% year over year to $932 million during the third quarter.|Meanwhile, Eliquis, a new blood thinner that Pfizer co-markets with Bristol-Myers Squibb, could eventually generate $4.2 billion in annual peak sales. However, blood thinners are a fairly crowded market, and one that could favor established drugs such as Bayer and Johnson & Johnson's Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa, which both arrived earlier than Eliquis.|The Foolish bottom lineIn a nutshell, Pfizer's future revenue growth is anything but guaranteed. While the peak sales estimates of Xalkori, Xeljanz, and Eliquis are impressive, their current sales numbers are not.|Nonetheless, investors should remember that Pfizer is very skilled at preserving its bottom line along with its forward annual dividend yield of 3.1%. Therefore, it's unlikely that Pfizer will collapse any time soon simply because it is still struggling to grow its top line.

However, SodaStream is in the infancy stages of being a threat to these two powerhouses.|SodaStream and big sodaIt's no secret that the health-conscious consumer is killing sparkling beverages (soda) in the domestic market. However, consumers in emerging markets aren't as educated about the health risks of overconsumption of soda. Coca-Cola is seeing solid growth for still beverages in the U.S. (ready-to-drink teas, juices, coffees, bottled water), while PepsiCo is seeing consistent growth in snacks (primarily Frito-Lay and Quaker). Therefore, it's not as though Coca-Cola and Pepsi are desperate, as some people would make it seem. If that were the case, then one of them would have scooped up SodaStream when rumors swirled about an acquisition in the early summer.|Think about the enormous marketing power of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. With that in mind, it's possible that these two companies are watching SodaStream's progress with the intention of creating their own products in the same market, which would put SodaStream in an extremely challenging position.|SodaStream is growing faster than Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the top and bottom lines, but this should be expected:|Coca-Cola and PepsiCo still offer brand recognition, geographic and product diversification, tremendous marketing power, resiliency to weak economies and bear markets, and generous yields, 2.70% for PepsiCo and 2.90% for Coca-Cola. If either of these companies sees SodaStream as a significant threat, something will be done. The problem is that nobody knows if this would be a move that would benefit or harm SodaStream. Of course, if it was news about a partnership or an acquisition, then the stock price would gap up.|The bottom lineDo you want to gamble? If so, consider SodaStream. Or, consider allocating a small percentage of your available capital to SodaStream, treating it as a speculative play.

The move would make a lot more sense for Verizon than a set-top box ever made for Intel. Verizon already delivers cable channels to about 5 million customers through its FiOS TV service and has an online streaming and DVD service partnership with Outerwall through Redbox Instant. Meanwhile, Intel doesn't have a great track record for selling devices directly to consumers and has virtually no experience procuring television content. On top of that, margins would be low for chips powering and Intel set-top box, which would make it hard to bring in significant profits for Intel, even if the device were successful.|No deal has been announced yet, and it's still not clear how Verizon would incorporate an Intel Media purchase. Verizon could adapt the box to its current FiOS service or use it for the Redbox Instant partnership. Intel could also keep partial control if a deal goes through.

The rest would come from a wet market, an electronics shop and government department stores, all within reach distance- and schedule-wise for shoppers going to work and back. You didn't need, say, Wal-Mart(WMT).|These factors also explain why Wal-Mart has boomed in China, with 400 stores and distribution centers there now and another 110 on the way.|The American retail giant with 11,000 stores worldwide said in Beijing in late October it will open the 110 outlets around China over the next three years and close 9% of the existing ones. The effort, which will employ 19,000 people, is aimed especially at second-tier and third-tier cities (easily more than one million people each). Over the same period, Wal-Mart will remodel scores of existing China stores.|A Wal-Mart store in China amalgamates enough sundry stuff in one place to cut out trips to other retailers and by all accounts sells for less than the ritzy malls -- though its China Web site doesn't list prices. Wal-Mart proposes remodeling 45 stores this year, 55 next year and 65 in 2015 partly to improve parking and store access, perfect for traffic-weary Chinese shoppers.|And Wal-Mart is helped by the fixation on foreign brands over local ones in China, no matter how down-market the brand may strike people from its country of origin -- consider McDonald's(MCD) and Yum Brands'(YUM) KFC.|The appeal of Chinese brands has been reduced with flap after flap about contaminated food going back to the late 2008 tainted milk powder scandals.

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:|"We rate Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations, growth in earnings per share and increase in net income. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated."|Wal-Mart Stores Inc has improved earnings per share by 5.1% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue.

This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($5.20 vs. $5.02).|The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. When compared to other companies in the Food & Staples Retailing industry and the overall market, Wal-Mart Stores Inc's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500.|Net operating cash flow has slightly increased to $6,357 million or 3.18% when compared to the same quarter last year.

That's the highest rate ever for the best-selling airliner in history and would produce more than 560 aircraft from that model per year. If you're keeping track, that's a production increase of nearly 50% since 2010.|"We're taking this step to make sure our airplanes get into the hands of our customers when they need them," said Beverly Wyse, vice president and general manager, 737 Program, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a press release. "Our employees and our suppliers have successfully increased the production rate to unmatched levels over the last three years. This increase will lay a solid foundation as we bridge into production on the 737 MAX."|The improved production rate will likely help margins going forward, but Boeing doesn't expect the move to have a significant impact on its 2013 financial results.|Boeing's 737 is highly efficient and a proven market leader. There have been more than 11,200 orders for the aircraft, which include in excess of 1,600 orders for the 737 MAX that will have a 14% fuel efficiency advantage over the best models in the industry. Majority of growth over the next two decades will come from single-aisle aircraft, and Boeing looks poised to capture more than its fair share.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/31/1-reason-boeings-margins-could-stay-flying-high.aspx|10/31/2013|0|"Boeing"|2|Boeing recently reported a robust third quarter, and even raised guidance going forward, much to the delight of investors. One of the biggest highlights from Boeing's third-quarter results was its improvement in commercial aircraft margins -- a welcome sight after its 787 Dreamliner program has struggled to remain profitable amid budget overruns and production delays. Are the higher margins here to stay? I'm not convinced, but here's one reason it's possible.|By the numbersOverall, Boeing's operating margin jumped 30 basis points to 8.1%, but most of that was driven by its commercial aircraft operating margins that jumped 210 basis points from 9.5% last year to 11.6%. Of course, investors would love to see those margins remain, but as production ramps up with its 787 Dreamliner, a much less efficient and mature operation, there will be more pressure on the margins to sink back down.|But on Wednesday, Boeing announced that it would be increasing the production on its 737 program to 47 aircraft per month by 2017 -- the highest rate ever for the best-selling airliner in history. Currently 38 airplanes per month are being produced, and it will increase to 42 in the first half of 2014 before reaching its goal of 47.|That means the 737 program will produce more than 560 aircraft per year -- that's an improvement of almost 50% since 2010. It should enable Boeing to improve margins on its 737 program, which will be a big deal considering the volume of deliveries the 737 accounts for.|Further, this production efficiency on its single-aisle aircraft will only grow in importance as Boeing predicts global growth over the next two decades to be focused on the segment, which the 737 currently leads.|Boeing hopes for its 737 MAX to take the baton from its previous generation of 737 aircraft and expand market share globally. Over the last decade fuel costs have doubled, making Boeing's customers focus on fuel efficiency; and the 737 MAX will deliver a big advantage. Boeing recently announced an improvement to its fuel economy, which now rates 14% higher than the industry's best single-aisle airplanes.|Bottom line Boeing's improved production rate on its 737 family should positively affect margins, although it won't have a significant effect for the remainder of 2013. Further, the 737 MAX's huge edge in fuel economy should bode well for sales. But the good news doesn't end there: Boeing's 737 family currently accounts for more than 3,400 unfilled orders, part of Boeing's huge $415 billion backlog that equates to 4.5 years' worth of sales, and as production ramps up it will enable the company to cash in on its enormous backlog faster.|Dividend stocks like Boeing can make you richIt's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn.

Caterpillar missed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, with most of that being due to weak mining equipment orders.|The continued slowdown in mining equipment demand hurts Caterpillar significantly because it has historically been the area of highest-margin sales for Cat, and the company is not far removed from its largest acquisition ever: mining equipment maker Bucyrus. Buying Bucyrus at the height of the mining cycle has many now believing that Caterpillar overpaid.|Looking forward, Caterpillar shared for the first time its 2014 guidance, projecting flat 2014 revenue from this year. The company expects to see continued strong mining production around the world going into 2014, but that hasn't been translating into orders lately. Investors must keep an eye on mining equipment demand, as well as the company's two other segments that Caterpillar hopes will pick up the slack.|Overall, there's not a ton to be optimistic about in the short term for Caterpillar.

The plant makes dippers and ballast boxes used in giant electric-powered mining shovels.|While Caterpillar has initiated temporary factory shutdowns, rolling layoffs, reductions in its flexible workforce, and cuts to discretionary and program costs, it's prudent for investors to ask if this "binging" is enough or will it continue to play economic catch-up? Of course, Wall Street analysts didn't see it coming either, and Cat continues to see signs of hope, but admits things remain dicey. Mine production levels remain elevated, so although that doesn't sound much different than its outlook in previous quarters, now it's occurring from a lower base.|What's benefited Caterpillar has been its ability to generate strong cash flows, particularly in machinery and power systems, despite the hits its resources operations have taken, allowing its balance sheet to improve and some $2 billion worth of stock to be bought back.
http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/10/31/why-deeres-dividend-is-poised-to-grow.aspx|10/31/2013|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|4|Heavy-equipment maker Deere (NYSE: DE) has capitalized on the success of the agricultural industry in recent years, using improving financial conditions in the sector to its advantage in boosting sales of its products to cash-flush farmers. Along the way, the company has rewarded shareholders with consistent dividend increases over the past decade. Even though Deere's shares have pulled back somewhat in light of weakening economic growth in key international markets, its dividend nevertheless offers advantages compared to heavy-equipment peers Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) .|Deere has had to face many of the same threats as Caterpillar and Joy Global, which have suffered from slower economic growth in China, as well as the fallout from dropping prices for the commodities that their mining-equipment customers rely on to finance major capital expenditures. Deere doesn't face the same challenge from the hard-hit mining industry, but it has increasingly relied on South American markets for growth, especially in its key agriculture and turf segment. Let's take a closer look at Deere and how its prospects for future growth could affect its dividend in the future.|Yet when you look more closely at Deere's results, you can see the big divide between the company's major segments. Agriculture-and-turf division sales rose 8%, but Deere's forestry and construction division experienced an 11% drop in revenue. That's consistent with the problems that Caterpillar and Joy Global have faced, as they don't have the ag-industry presence to offset the weakness on the industrial side of their respective businesses. Poor guidance for the current quarter, with expectations for continued pressure from the construction and forestry business, hurt Deere's share price after the announcement, and it could weigh on the company's overall results for years to come.|When will Deere boost its payout? With Deere just having made a more than 10% increase to its quarterly payout back in March, investors shouldn't expect another increase before 2014. Looking forward, though, an increase to $0.56 or $0.57 per share on a quarterly basis would still leave Deere with a sizable margin of safety compared to its earnings. It would also push Deere's yield up toward the 2.8% that Caterpillar currently pays. As long as the agricultural industry keeps thriving, Deere shareholders should continue to enjoy solid payouts.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/31/capital-spending-in-the-mining-sector-is-declining.aspx|10/31/2013|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|2|Why Haven't Caterpillar's Wings Fluttered?|Caterpillar's (NYSE: CAT) fiscal third quarter results released last week did not make for good reading. The company noted revenue and income declines across all divisions. In addition, the company reported that it was revising its full-year profit forecast down by $1 per share to $5.50, from $6.50 previously. What's more, the company reported that revenues from its resource industries division, which is principally engaged in the manufacture of mining equipment, collapsed 75% year-on-year.|Unfortunately, Caterpillar has reported a pickup in mining sector activity during the past few months, but this has not translated into an increase in demand for the company's equipment. That said, Caterpillar's reported order backlog for the end of the third quarter remained constant at $19.1 billion. This was similar, to the figure reported at the end of the second quarter as a rise in construction equipment orders offset weakness within the resource industries sector .|No escape Caterpillar is lucky as the company is able to offset declining CapEx in the mining sector with increased sales to the construction sector. Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) is not so lucky. Within the company's fiscal third quarter results, Joy reported a 36% decline in new-order bookings. What's more, the company's order backlog declined 27% from the previous quarter as Joy worked through existing orders.|Surprisingly, Sandvik's order backlog for its mining equipment declined less than that of both Joy and Caterpillar, which indicates that the company is in a better position to ride out the collapse in mining CapEx than its peers . That said, Sandvik has other problems, namely the strong Swedish Kronor and rising metals prices, which hit operating profit to the tune of 250 million and 90 million kronor respectively during the fiscal third quarter, this was roughly 14% of quarterly operating profit .|Foolish summarySo overall, capital spending within the mining sector is declining rapidly and faster than originally thought. However, Caterpillar and Sandvik are well placed to ride out this decline. Joy on the other hand is not so lucky and the company is really suffering. That said, Joy's management has taken the prudent decision to buy back stock while interest rates are low and this should boost future earnings.

Just as Exxon reported earlier today, Chevron said it thought that results for its upstream operations, which include exploration and production activity, would improve slightly. However, Chevron expected significantly lower earnings from its downstream segment, which is also consistent with what Exxon reported today.|The key for Chevron, though, will be whether it can follow Exxon's lead in boosting production levels. Exxon's report included a 1.5% jump in oil-equivalent production volumes, with growth coming primarily from more-valuable oil and liquids production at the expense of declines from natural gas. By contrast, Chevron's interim report showed a much more balanced strategy, with total expected year-over-year production growth of 2.9% coming from a 4.2% gain in natural-gas production and a 2.2% rise in liquids.|Chevron's different approach to the energy market should give investors a broader picture of the industry when it reports tomorrow, and topping Exxon's growth could be seen by investors as validation of Chevron's long-term strategy. For the Dow, affirming a natural-gas-friendly approach to energy could bolster the many initiatives that companies are contemplating to take advantage of the cheap, clean-burning fuel around the world.|Look beyond the majorsChevron and Exxon are positioning themselves for the rapidly changing energy markets, but record oil and natural gas production is leading to historic amounts of capital expenditures flooding the industry.

Shinder said Donziger had sought to assure him Chevron's claims were "trumped up" and inaccurate.|In March 2010, Shinder's firm agreed to represent the plaintiffs in cases Chevron had filed in the United States seeking evidence in aid of the Ecuador litigation.|"It bothered me and still bothers me that we'll never know if there was a case against Chevron," Shinder said.|Stratus Consulting, once a co-defendant in the New York case, settled with Chevron in April.

Yet despite a 2.4% decline in revenue to $112.4 billion, Exxon's numbers topped what investors had expected, and gains in oil and natural-gas production reversed falling production levels from earlier in the year.|Exxon's numbers showed sharp disparities among the oil giant's divisions. Upstream earnings, which include Exxon's exploration and production businesses, soared 12% to $6.71 billion, with more than half of the year-over-year gains coming from higher proceeds of oil and gas sales during the quarter. Overall oil-equivalent production rose 1.5%, but those increases were skewed toward the more lucrative oil and liquids side of the business, with liquids production rising almost 4% while natural-gas production fell 1.3%. Domestic earnings soared by almost two-thirds, far outpacing Exxon's international earnings growth in the upstream segment.|Meanwhile, downstream earnings, which include Exxon's refining and marketing operations, plunged 81% to $592 million as weaker refining margins were responsible for the bulk of the decline. On the other hand, Exxon's chemical segment benefited from better margins, but its 30% jump in earnings provided only a relatively small boost to overall net income.|Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson put the results in a positive light, saying that they "reflect our continued progress across a diverse set of profitable growth opportunities." Even with the earnings declines, Exxon spent $10.5 billion on capital and exploration expenditures during the third quarter, and returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and dividend payments.|As of 8:30 a.m. EDT, Exxon shares were up about three-quarters of a percent in pre-market trading.

As All Things D notes, the carrier "already serves up conventional pay TV to more than five million subscribers via its FiOS unit, and sells broadband access to nearly six million subscribers." Verizon also launched a DVD rental and streaming-movie service, Redbox Instant, this year.

The company has revised down its sales' outlook for 2013 from $56-$58 billion to $55 billion; for 2014 the company expects sales to remain flat. Cummins' revenues slightly rose by 4% in the third quarter but didn't meet the market expectations .|Cummins, much likeCaterpillar, revised its outlook downward. It estimates its revenues will decline by 3% year over year in 2013, rather than remaining flat as previously estimated. In the first nine months of 2013, the company's revenues fell by 2.5%, suggesting the fourth quarter may show an even steeper drop in sales.|The chart above shows that Joy Global's operating profit is nearly three times that of Caterpillar. Even if the company's profitability were to decline, it would still remain high for the industry. This high profitability also means high free cash flow.|Joy Global's enterprise value and its EV-to-EBITDA ratio were compared to Caterpillar, Cummins and the average Machinery industry. This will provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation for Joy Global's valuation.|Based on the above, Joy Global's EV-to-EBITDA ratio of only 6 is the lowest of the three companies, even falling below the industry average. In comparison, Caterpillar's EV-to- EBITDA ratio is 9.89, which is close to the industry average.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/30/will-this-dead-cat-bounce-or-come-back-to-life-aga.aspx|10/30/2013|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|2|"This year has proven to be difficult..." according to Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) . With earnings down over 40% in the third quarter, that would seem an understatement. Since this year is a bust, the big question is what happens in 2014?|Mining the problemsCaterpillar has invested heavily in the mining industry. The logic behind the choice is sound. Mining equipment is heavily used, thus requiring frequent replacement. And there is a big market for parts, which wear out quickly because of near constant use. This suggests a robust new equipment market and a growing parts business, which provides a relatively stable recurring income stream.|However, Caterpillar's timing hasn't been so good. Over the last year or so the mining industry has been in triage mode. That's why the company's Resource Industries segment, which sells to miners, accounted for 75% of Caterpillar's third quarter shortfall. While other business lines have been weak, too, until the mining industry starts to rebound, performance will likely remain subpar.|Cutting backCaterpillar has been cutting back, reducing expenses by $700 million and cutting capital expenditures by some $400 million. This has included trimming its payroll by 13,000 employees over the past year. The company, however, isn't the only one working on cost savings, which is why 2014 isn't likely to see much of an improvement over 2013.|Another part of the problem for Caterpillar, however, is that BHP Billiton is also focusing on increasing its productivity. For example, the company has increased its 2014 iron ore guidance by five million tonnes because of the "deployment of mobile crushing units and the continued de-bottlenecking of the supply chain." Although a portion of this increase was the result of an investment in equipment, longer-term productivity improvements reduce the need for new equipment even though the company is pulling more product out of the ground.|Until supply and demand come back into balance, capital spending in the mining industry is likely to remain weak. BHP and Teck are just two examples of the cost cutting trend. But the pair highlights the long-term nature of the issue. This means that Caterpillar's mining sales will remain a weak spot.|That said, the capital spending pullback can only last so long. Watch the financial results and spending patterns at big miners like BHP, Teck, and Peabody Energy for a sign of things to come at Caterpillar. Caterpillar's business isn't likely to pick up until after the miners see an uptick, however, so don't expect 2014 to be much better than 2013.
http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/10/30/is-caterpillars-dividend-streak-in-jeopardy.aspx|10/30/2013|0|"Caterpillar Inc"|0|Is Caterpillar's Dividend Streak in Jeopardy?|Caterpillar's (NYSE: CAT) fortunes have soared over the past 20 years, as the rise of emerging economies creating brand-new markets for the heavy-equipment manufacturer. Those opportunities helped Caterpillar become a dividend giant, establishing a 20-year track record of annual payout increases that has boosted its quarterly dividend more than 30-fold over that time frame. But now that Caterpillar's earnings have fallen substantially, dividend investors need to watch to make sure the stock's payout remains secure.|The same trends that helped Caterpillar rise so sharply since the early 1990s are now creating challenges for the company, as sluggish construction and infrastructure activity in China and the rest of the emerging market world has weighed on its growth prospects. At the same time, plunging commodity prices have led to problems for Caterpillar as well as mining equipment specialist Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) and engine producer Cummins (NYSE: CMI) , which supplies motors for excavators and other mining equipment. With Caterpillar expecting weak earnings into the future, will the double hit from construction and mining force the heavy-equipment giant to rein in its dividend growth? Let's take a closer look at Caterpillar to see how healthy its dividend looks right now.|Dividend Stats on Caterpillar|Why Caterpillar has some breathing room Caterpillar has treated long-term investors well, with solid share price gains adding to its steadily growing dividend. But more recently, Caterpillar's stock has dropped substantially since early 2012, ever since the slowdown in the Chinese economy really took hold. The equipment maker has been among the worst performers in the Dow, losing ground even as the broader stock market has climbed to record-high levels.|Caterpillar's third-quarter results reveal most of the construction equipment giant's challenges. Net income plunged by 44% on an 18% pullback in revenue, and the company cut its earnings guidance for the full year. That's consistent with the results that Joy Global gave, with a 42% drop in bookings coming from its underground mining segment, and Cummins also blamed mining for its earnings miss and guidance cut. Yet even outside mining, tough conditions have weighed on results, as Deere (NYSE: DE) recently reported an 11% drop in revenue for its construction and forestry segment and expects further declines for the full 2013 year.|Still, the hope for Caterpillar is that once conditions start to improve in key markets like China, it could end up recovering more quickly than Deere or Joy Global. One reason for optimism is that Caterpillar is still working hard to keep its margins up, staring down weak demand by nevertheless imposing price increases on most of its machine line for next year. That sort of long-term perspective separates Caterpillar from less experienced companies that might be tempted to offer discounts to counter flagging sales.|Caterpillar hasn't let its recent struggles stop it from delivering exceptional dividend growth, with a 15% increase in its July dividend payment marking the second straight double-digit percentage rise for Caterpillar's payout. Deere and Cummins boast an even stronger track record over the past few years, but neither they nor Joy Global has demonstrated the long-term commitment to shareholders to deliver consistent dividend increases over time.|When will Caterpillar boost its payout?Because the Dividend Aristocrats look at annual payouts rather than quarterly ones in determining streaks of increases, Caterpillar's mid-year dividend increase in July actually gives it the ability to wait until 2015 for its next boost without jeopardizing its streak. Based on past experience during troubled times, Caterpillar might well take advantage of that latitude to shore up its earnings and prevent its payout ratio from getting too high. That might not make dividend investors happy, but in the long run, it should lead to more sustainable payouts for Caterpillar that could prevent a more disruptive dividend cut down the line.|Is Caterpillar the best dividend stock out there?Caterpillar looks like it should keep its dividend intact for now, although not everyone would agree about its long-term prospects. Still, there's one thing most investors can agree on: Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine.

The ACCORD-Lipid trial showed that triglyceride levels improved when patients were given AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) Tricor, but the drug had no effect on adverse cardiovascular events. Another trial, called AIM-HIGH -- testing the organic compound niacin like what's in AbbVie's Niaspan -- also failed to show better outcomes for patients taking the drug. Merck (NYSE: MRK) had a similar result with its niacin-containing Cordaptive; the drug failed to improve outcomes despite improving both triglyceride and cholesterol levels.|But even with the SPA still in place, the FDA was obviously against the expanded authorization, and after a substantially negative advisory panel meeting Amarin already had no shot at getting Vascepa approved. Pulling the SPA is just the last nail in the coffin. It doesn't change anything because Vascepa's chances for expanded approval were already killed by the trials run on AbbVie's and Merck's drugs.|Buying opportunity?Amarin still has a chance to expand the use of Vascepa into patients with moderately high triglyceride levels if the outcomes trial is positive. Vascepa works in a different way than AbbVie's Tricor and Niaspan and Merck's Cordaptive, so it's conceivable that Vascepa could improve outcomes even though the others didn't. Unfortunately, the trial won't read out until late 2015 at the earliest and could take until 2017 if Amarin has to wait for the final results.

While contrarian investors might be turned off by the stock's steady climb in 2013, Sole believes that there's some decent room to run given his view that Nike is on the cusp of solid EPS growth acceleration.|Now what: Morgan Stanley thinks the stock can deliver an annual 10% return over the next three years. "Nike dominates the industry and we think it's at a tipping point of major EPS growth acceleration sustaining a 17% 4-year EPS CAGR," noted Morgan Stanley. "Nike's powerful balance sheet is helping it create a virtuous circle of outsized investment spending, operational excellence, brand strength, and ROIC gains." With the stock hitting a new 52-week high today and trading at a P/E premium to its long-term average, however, I'd wait for a wider margin of safety in case Nike doesn't grow as quickly as Morgan Stanley expects.

Today it's different. Companies like Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA) have such strong brands and loyalty that customers already know what they want. The end result is that they can buy directly from Nike or Under Armour without having to go to their local sporting goods store. This trend is bad news for companies like Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) .|The top sportswear and apparel companyNike remains the top dog in the sportswear and athletic footwear market worldwide. To remain the top dog, Nike continues to innovate and expand its product offerings. One area where Nike looks to get ahead of its competition is in wearable devices. Nike's new Fuelband SE is an update of its original Fuelband with some major improvements.|What I like about the new Fuelband SE is that it has Bluetooth 4.0, which allows it to be synced with the Fuelband app on iPhone or Android. The device comes with smarter motion sensors that improve fitness tracking. Nike is going to sell the device for $149, and it hits shelves in November.|At Nike's 2013 Investor Meeting, CEO Mark Parker was very optimistic about the company's prospects going forward. Nike forecasts strong sales gains in apparel, its women's line, and e-commerce. By 2017, apparel sales are forecast to grow from $7.5 billion to $10 billion. Its women's business is expected to almost double to $7 billion from $4 billion. E-commerce sales are forecast to grow to $2 billion, and total sales are forecast to grow to $36 billion by 2017.|Still a lot of armour in this companyWhile smaller than Nike, Under Armour has made great progress in the sportswear and apparel market. Under Armour just reported earnings that came in $0.02 better than expectations. Revenue grew 26% Y/Y. Net income grew 27% compared to the third quarter of last year. Under Armour is still growing rapidly, and for the full year, the company expects total revenues to grow 26% compared to last year.|In many ways, Under Armour is copying the pages from Nike's playbook. The company has endorsement deals with several notable athletes, including Michael Phelps, Bryce Harper and Cam Newton. In addition, Under Armour is now in the athletic shoe business, and its shoes are catching on with a younger generation.|Foolish assessmentWhile I like shopping at Dick's stores, I just feel that the growth is no longer there. Even though Dick's has an online presence, I feel that more consumers are going to be purchasing their apparel needs directly from Nike and Under Armour. While Dick's does have the Nike and Under Armour shop-within-a-shops at its stores, consumer shopping preferences are changing, and many prefer buying direct from the source. I see this having a much greater impact on Dick's over the long run.|Both Nike and Under Armour are continuing to innovate, and there remains tremendous growth for both companies overseas. Populations are growing much faster overseas, particularly in Asia, and the demand is there for sportswear and apparel worn by people's favorite athletes. Both companies are growing in the double-digits, and I see that trend continuing.

Yet saturation becomes a worry at some point, not to mention the fact that the company is heavily weighted toward shoes. So why invest in a slow growth shoe company when you can invest in the fast growing apparel market?|Under Armour (NYSE: UA) is a smaller, and much more nimble company than Nike. It gets about 70% of revenue from apparel, with nearly 20% from footwear. During Q2, Under Armour's revenues in both North America and internationally went up big; North America revenue rose nearly 23% year-over-year, while international revenue was up 25%.|Wearables creates an opportunityOne of the big opportunities for Under Armour lies in the fact that the "wearables" market remains wide open. Nike has its well-known Fuel band, but Under Armour has yet to make a big splash in this market, though that may well be about to change. Take Under Armour's Tech shirt for example, which has the technology for reading heart rates, and other info, built directly into the shirt.|Another one of Under Armour's big splashes in the wearable tech market is its Armour 39, which is a heart rate monitor chest strap for athletes that even claims to measure willpower. As mentioned, Nike's most compelling offering in the wearable space is its Fuel band. If the success of this device is any indication of how popular wearables are, then Under Armour investors should be very excited. For fiscal 2012, Nike's equipment segment (which includes the Fuel band) profits jumped 18% year over year. In fiscal 2011, this segment saw a 1% decline in profits year over year.|In addition to Nike, Under Armour could see increased competition from Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) , which is another up-and-coming activewear maker. Lulu is currently heavily weighted toward the women's business in the U.S. While the company is trying to break into the men's activewear market, it still has a long way to go. Both Lulu and Under Armour, however, trade with forward P/E ratios above Nike. Lulu has a price to earnings ratio of 40, Under Armour is at 65, while Nike is at 26. . So, Nike is the cheapest, but it's expected to grow earnings per share the lowest of the three, at only 12.7% annualized over the next five years. Compare this to Lulu's 18.7% and Under Armour's 21%.|The company should be one of investors' focuses when looking for strong growth stocks. Meanwhile Nike's growth story has already played out, and Lulu still has much to prove, including if it can break into men's apparel.

Its blockbuster cholesterol-fighting agent, Lipitor -- formerly the world's top-selling drug -- lost its patent in late 2011. Whole sales were down 29% from one year ago, but the drug still beat expectations by $55 million for earnings of $533 million. Viagra, Pfizer's perhaps more infamous drug, battled generics in Europe less successfully with a 11% decrease in sales this quarter; it is still under patent in the U.S. Generic drugs for Effexor, Zoloft, and Detrol also continued to dig away at sales.|As for current sales, Pfizer's cancer drugs skyrocketed 24% this quarter to $407 million in revenue, and the oncology unit is certainly one of Pfizer's strongest. Part of this surge can be attributed to several new cancer agents. New lung cancer drug Xalkori reported a 92% increase in revenue, and kidney cancer drug Inlyta had a 186% increase in revenue.|Pfizer's pipeline is also quite impressive, with several trial results expected in the next few months and 76 treatments formally in the pipeline. Notable phase 3 agents include breast cancer therapy palbociclid, cholesterol agent bococizumab, diabetes drug ertugliflozin, and pain therapy tanezumab.|Prevnar, Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine, was approved in Europe for adults and expects further study results early next year. Eliquis, an anti-thombotic currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, has yet to see sales take off, but is seeking FDA approval for use in deep vein thrombosis. Menopause therapy Duavee was approved by the FDA and will hit markets in early 2014.|Merck's pipeline is also weaker than Pfizer's, and its strongest agent is perhaps cancer treatment MK3475, a PD-1 agent in direct competition with agents also in development by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche. The company is also undergoing major restructuring, with a wave of 8,500 layoffs currently in the works.|Bottom LinePatent expirations are a common problem with all of these drug giants, and each company has worked to identify a saving grace. Pfizer enjoys a very strong oncology unit, a filled pipeline of late-stage potential blockbusters, and strong sales of its patent-protected agents. It also has implemented a new structure of three units: proprietary pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and generic drugs.

Proposed rate cuts for next year caused an insurer panic earlier this year. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, backed away from its proposed 2% rate cut and instead plans a 3% increase.|But that rate increase is still lower than in previous years, which is why UnitedHealth's saying that rates will contribute to the company adjusting its 2014 guidance during its investor conference in January.|Why's Medicaid included in the table? That government-backed program is also undergoing Obamacare changes. States were given the choice to participate in a Medicaid expansion program that would've widened the umbrella to include low-income people who currently have an income too high to qualify. More patients leads to more profit potential for insurers. And UnitedHealth has more exposure to Medicaid than Medicare Advantage.|Foolish final thoughtsWill Medicare Advantage cuts constrict UnitedHealth in 2014? Sure -- but not as much as competing insurers such as Humana, which have more exposure. UnitedHealth is more dependent on the Medicaid expansion and the outcomes of its private exchange performance, since the company's only dipping a toe into the federal exchange.|All of the insurers face a bumpy path under Obamacare as everything falls into place. So expect a lot of readjustments for the near future. But investors can tune into UnitedHealth's investor day on Jan. 15 for a better idea of what the company sees as its future.

By now you have surely heard this formulaic phrase countless times to describe any number of investment opportunities in the emerging markets. Often these phrases can mean very little, but occasionally they can mean everything. Case in point: Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica (NASDAQOTH: WMMVY) literally translates to "Wal-Mart of Mexico and Central America."|The Wal-Mart of Mexico and Central AmericaWal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica traces its origins back to 1958, but in its present form it began as a 1991 joint venture to open Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs stores in Mexico. Today this Mexican Stock Exchange-traded company is 70% owned by Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , and its operations now include the Central American nations of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. All together, Wal-Mart de Mexico has 2,768 stores in a region that encompasses more than 155 million people.|Of the 2,786 store locations in these six countries, 251 are Wal-Mart stores and 167 are Sam's Clubs. The remaining 2,350 stores are comprised of various brands of discount department stores, discount warehouses, membership warehouse clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies, and clothing apparel stores. Wal-Mart de Mexico's operations also include Banco Wal-Mart with its over one million Mexican bank accounts, as well as its major e-commerce presence with Walmart.com.mx and Mexico's leading online grocery sales site Superama.com.mx.|Mexico The Mexican division of Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica is the much larger of the two, making up about 86% of total company revenue and 76% of the company's store count. The Mexican division is also the largest retailer in Mexico, far larger than its nearest Mexican competitor. This past quarter the Mexican division contributed 87.2 billion pesos ($6.76 billion USD) in revenue, while Mexico's No. 2 retailer -- Organizacion Soriana -- did just 799 million pesos ($62 million USD) during its most recently reported quarter.|Despite this dominance over Mexican retail, Mexico has been a recent challenge for Wal-Mart de Mexico due to the slowdown in that country's economy. In the first and second quarters of this year, the Mexican economy grew just 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the first quarter 2012 and second quarter 2012 growth of 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively. This low Mexican GDP growth can similarly be observed in Wal-Mart de Mexico's third quarter earnings released last week; the Mexican division's revenue increased only 1.7% over its third quarter 2012 revenue.|Central AmericaWhile the Mexican side of Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica has been a challenge as of late, Central America remains an attractive market with great growth potential. The company expanded into Central America in 2010, and this region of nearly 40 million people currently has just 19 Wal-Mart stores and exactly zero Sam's Club locations. As a point of comparison, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona with their combined population of 34.7 million people have 549 Wal-Mart stores and 97 Sam's Clubs locations (as well as two Supermercados).|Much of Central America's retail sector can be described as informal. These are small, local, independent retailers with no real size, scale, or widespread distribution. In other words, this is a rather inefficient retail market ready and waiting for some company to come in, disrupt, and consolidate. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the single best positioned company to be that disruptor.|Foolish bottom lineInvesting in Latin America is not without its risks. That has been particularly true this year, with many Latin American economies slowing down and falling out of investor favor. With shares down over 20% year to date, Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica is no exception. Despite this, there are still great opportunities to be had in Latin America. For those investors able to think long term, the future rewards of Wal-Mart de Mexico could very well be worth the risks of today.|Don't forget about Wal-Mart's fantastic dividendDividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/30/can-will-arnett-and-other-initiatives-drive-growth.aspx|10/30/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|2|If you're looking for a comparison with a company that primarily operates in the physical world, then let's use Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , which ranks No. 44 in the United States, and it's down 31 spots to rank No. 200 globally over the past three months. Pageviews-per-user is down 10.49% to 5.89, time-on-site is down 19% to 5:03, and bounce rate is up 19% to 32.60.|Wal-Mart, on the other hand, delivered diluted EPS of $4.52 in FY 2012 and $5.02 in FY 2013. Therefore, Wal-Mart is likely to remain the most reliable of the three when it comes to returning capital to shareholders. Wal-Mart currently yields 2.50%, whereas Best Buy yields 1.60%. Amazon doesn't offer any yield.|With Amazon stronger on the top line and Wal-Mart stronger on the bottom line, it seems illogical to opt for Best Buy as an investment. One argument in Best Buy's favor is that it offers a more attractive valuation of 16 times forward earnings versus 129 times forward earnings for Amazon. Wal-Mart is trading at 13 times forward earnings.|The bearish argument is that Wal-Mart can easily build out to offer similar products at similar prices (with more marketing power) while Best Buy doesn't stand a chance of competing with Amazon online.|Best Buy has proven naysayers (like myself) wrong so far this year, with the stock appreciating 267% year to date. I don't own positions in any of these stocks, but if I wanted growth, I would go with Amazon. If I wanted safe dividend payments, I would go with Wal-Mart.

These companies are different from the other major credit card brands like American Express (NYSE: AXP) in that they merely provide payment processing and support services -- they don't actually issue the credit cards that bear their brands.|An alternative: similar but differentAmerican Express is a viable alternative that is looking more attractively valued at current levels, but is still expensive on a historical basis. Unlike the other two companies, American Express issues its own cards and has a leading position in global travel services.|The company's name is practically synonymous with the concept of a traveler's check, and it has done an excellent job of improving its international revenue stream over the past few years. More than half of American Express' revenue comes from U.S. card spending (interest and fees), a revenue stream that neither Visa nor MasterCard has (at least not directly).|Additionally, American Express is the cheapest company on a valuation basis, by far. It is expected to report earnings of $4.91 per share this year, meaning it trades for 16.8 times current year earnings, much better than the other two. While annual earnings growth is expected to be somewhat less (around 12% annually for the next three years), its valuation is more justified.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/should-att-be-part-of-your-portfolio.aspx|10/29/2013|0|"AT&T"|0|Should AT&T Be Part of Your Portfolio?|The wireless industry is taking an interesting turn with rising threat from smaller national carriers Sprint and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) . While Sprint is intensely involved in building its Network Vision, T-Mobile is aggressively working on marketing campaigns targeting budget-bound customers to shift from rival networks, particularly AT&T (NYSE: T) . However, the Dallas carrier's third-quarter results for the fiscal year stayed strong as its subscriber base showed decent growth and its data plans generated good revenue.|Quarter in a snapshotAT&T's consolidated revenue increased 2.2% to $32.2 billion compared to the same quarter last year. Wireless revenue went up 5.1% to $17.5 billion, while operating income increased 3.4% to $4.6 billion. Increasing data usage from heavy Internet users led the carrier to report a 17.6% rise in wireless data revenue. The continued shift to smartphones, tablets, and similar devices has increased the consumption of data, driving wireless revenue growth.|AT&T's operating income marginally increased to $6.2 billion from $6 billion in the third quarter of 2013. The net income attributable to AT&T was $3.8 billion over last year's $3.6 billion. The mobile operator posted a solid quarter, though there were concerns regarding increased competition from T-Mobile, thanks to new smartphone connections and higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, which notably bolstered wireless revenue.|Subscriber additions -- the saviorThe second-largest national carrier is currently focusing on subscriber addition and boosting ARPU. AT&T recorded a total increase of nearly 989,000 wireless subscribers during the quarter. Of the total, 363,000 connections were postpaid customers, more than twice the additions that the company made last year. This is good news for the carrier, as postpaid connections are most profitable.|In addition, of the total postpaid connections, 178,000 were smartphone users who are increasingly becoming heavy Internet consumers. This is precisely why AT&T's ARPU for smartphone subscribers is more than twice the ARPU of its non-smartphone customer base. This automatically boosted the ARPU for postpaid handsets, which rose 3.1%. Also, AT&T experienced record sales of 6.7 million smartphones, which accounted for 89% of postpaid sales for the quarter. The expansion of the smartphone base is essential to driving ARPU growth, and in turn, wireless revenue in the face of rising competition.|Unfortunately, the situation doesn't look so promising for AT&T anymore. Increasing subscriber base is a necessity for any carrier to grow, but if AT&T charges more to enjoy higher ARPU, it may lose a good number of subscribers to Sprint and T-Mobile, in particular, which is very candid about offering lower plan prices to lure customers away from AT&T's network.|Growing threatPreviously, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) was the only carrier effectively competing with AT&T. But, now both of the smaller national players are putting in huge effort to give solid competition to the virtual duopoly.|T-Mobile, on the other hand, is increasingly posing a threat to the telecom giants, AT&T in particular. The fourth-largest national player is offering simplified, cheaper plans to win subscribers from bigger rivals. The carrier recorded the addition of 685,000 contract subscribers in the last quarter. Also, T-Mobile is pretty vocal about targeting AT&T's customer base. Just before AT&T released its earnings, T-Mobile announced its free monthly data offer of 200MB for iPad users.|Foolish bottom lineAT&T's third quarter has been impressive. Competition is heating up, but AT&T is also planning its moves accordingly. The carrier made a huge capital investment of $6 billion in the third quarter for network upgrading to keep its edge over Sprint and T-Mobile. Currently, Verizon leads as far as LTE network coverage, which has helped the telecom player maintain its supremacy over fellow rivals. AT&T's LTE network covers around 250 million Americans. The wireless provider is expected to spend heavily on network upgrades over the next couple of years. Obviously, such huge investments would build pressure on the company's profitability margins, but they are unavoidable if the carrier wants to stay competitive.|AT&T is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.89 and is expected to grow in the future. As per its projected earnings for the next fiscal year, the stock is trading just 13.18 times its earnings. In fact, AT&T is the most attractive stock compared to its peers. Verizon has a forward P/E of 14.41, while T-Mobile is has a forward P/E 32.05.|Additionally, AT&T has made huge investments to differentiate its network, providing quality and high speed Internet service. In fact, the carrier's network speed beats Big Red's speed as found in recent tests. AT&T has an encouraging future outlook and I strongly believe that this cheap telecom stock could add spark to your portfolio.

The standard enterprise setup, which includes things like the traditional telephone, is disappearing, and telecommunications firms like AT&T (NYSE: T) know it.|In March, AT&T announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to expand its UC portfolio. The company will be integrating its global IP network with Microsoft Lync, which will allow customers to utilize real-time collaboration on documents, participate in high-definition video conferences and virtual meetings, and provide a "full range of enterprise voice capabilities." Lync will also allow AT&T business customers to "use instant messaging presence to quickly find and communicate with colleagues," according to a press release.|The deal is important for AT&T because it not only bolsters its overall UC portfolio, but also gives it credibility by partnering with a leader. According to Microsoft, "60% of enterprises (500+ seats) surveyed are deploying or planning to deploy Lync, including enterprise voice, up from 45% last year." AT&T now has very lucrative exposure to the rapidly growing Microsoft Lync, as well as further diversification in its business-centered offerings.|The bottom lineUnified communications, especially cloud-based voice and video, will continue to be adopted by enterprises going forward, providing growth for Microsoft and Cisco. The two companies are the most dominant forces in UC, and will continue to dig their moats deeper. Telecoms like AT&T will also receive growth from this trend as more cloud-based services are utilized and more data is used.

Source: Boeing.|As I wrote about a month ago, Boeing (NYSE: BA) received a slap in the face when South Korea rejected the aerospace giant's bid to deliver 60 fighter jets, even though Boeing offered the lone bid that met the government's original $7.8 billion budget figure.|Now Boeing says it's open to having South Korea buy a mix of its F-15 Silent Eagle fighter jets and Lockheed Martin's F-35 model.|"If it turns out a split of 40 F-15s and 20 F-35s is the right answer, then, of course we will want to participate in that," said James Armington, vice president for East Asia-Pacific business development at Boeing's defense unit, according to a Bloomberg report. "Whatever the requirement is determined to be, whatever the need is determined to be, we definitely want to participate."|South Korea primarily rejected Boeing's original bid over doubts that the F-15 is sophisticated enough to counter North Korea's nuclear threat. One previous Boeing F-15 pilot countered that the Silent Eagle's speed, payload, and use of "standoff" weaponry would make it a better asset when attacking nuclear weapons, which make challenging targets.|Winning a partial South Korean contract would still be big for Boeing and its investors, considering that the company's defense segment is expected to shrink as major U.S. budget cuts take place -- up to $1 trillion over the next nine years.|Dividend Stocks Like Boeing Can Make You RichIt's as simple as that.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/can-boeing-and-its-suppliers-succeed-by-teaming-up.aspx|10/29/2013|0|"Boeing"|0|Can Boeing and Its Suppliers Succeed by Teaming Up?|Boeing (NYSE: BA) has launched a new program to help its suppliers -- in return for a little favor from them. The aerospace giant's offering to work closely with the companies that supply parts for its military and commercial aircraft, helping them redesign their supply chains and improve their productivity. But in exchange, those suppliers will have to charge Boeing less when they renew their contracts. Let's see how this program might affect two of Boeing's most prominent suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR) and TransDigm (NYSE: TDG).|Everything is relativeOne easy way of assessing the impact of Boeing's "Partnering for Success" program on a supplier is to find out how much of its revenues come from Boeing. Boeing accounted for 84% and 13% of the fiscal 2012 sales for Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm, respectively. However, it would be misleading to simply conclude that Spirit AeroSystems will suffer more from Boeing's new initiatives than TransDigm. There are other factors at play here.|About three-quarters of TransDigm's revenues are generated from products, for which it is the sole supplier to its customers. In Spirit AeroSystems' case, it is the only supplier for almost all of the products it supplies to Boeing. Moreover, Spirit AeroSystems' supply agreements with Boeing are typically long-term, lasting for the full length of the aircraft programs. As a result, both TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems have sufficient bargaining power to resist any unreasonable price reductions, since Boeing may have trouble finding alternative suppliers.|It's tough to switchBuilding aircraft isn't child's play; there are thousands of lives at stake with each flight. Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing take a long time to carry out testing and certification for new suppliers, to ensure that the high quality and safety standards are upheld.|Assuming that Boeing is willing to go through this laborious process of qualifying new suppliers, potential rival suppliers still may not be willing to enter certain product segments which incumbents like Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm already dominate. The huge capital investment required is a natural barrier to entry.|There are also other factors specific to the two suppliers that make it so difficult for Boeing to turn to alternative suppliers.|TransDigm's niche aerospace parts tend to make up a relatively small part of the total cost of a plane, which suggest that Boeing should look elsewhere to really bring down its costs. In general, customers are more price-sensitive when a particular product makes up a big proportion of their budgets. It looks like Boeing has indeed given TransDigm greater leeway in its pricing, allowing it to deliver consistent gross margins exceeding 50% since its IPO in 2006.|Business isn't just about hard numbers, either; relationships play a big part in deciding who gets what. Spirit AeroSystems was started in 2005, after Canadian private equity firm Onex purchased what was once Boeing's "in-house" manufacturing facilities for fuselage, propulsion and wing systems. Many members of Spirit AeroSystems' management team are former Boeing employees. Current CEO Jeffrey Turner used to be General Manager of the Boeing Wichita Division, and worked there for more than three decades. It will be almost impossible for another supplier to build such deep relationships with Boeing.|The view from BoeingBoeing managed to expand its operating margins for the Commercial Airplanes segment by 210 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, which could be attributed to higher delivery volume and productivity gains. In a response to an analyst query about the "Partnering for Success" program at the results conference call, CEO James McNerney said that tactics such as sourcing in-house or switching suppliers will be less important if suppliers believe in what Boeing's objective of driving the highest margins for both itself and its suppliers. But he did add that "those tactics are available to us."|I don't doubt that many suppliers could potentially improve their cost structure by working with Boeing. However, it never hurts to have a few extra bargaining chips when come to the negotiating table with this aerospace giant.|ConclusionI'm not claiming that Boeing's "Partnering for Success" program won't affect suppliers at all. There's no denying that Boeing's scale gives it tremendous bargaining power. However, each supplier will be affected to a different extent, depending on a variety of factors which I have touched on above.|In my opinion, Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm are less likely to be affected. It's too expensive for Boeing to switch to other suppliers, and too difficult for those potential suppliers to enter the market in the first place.

Yet unlike fellow defense-industry players Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) , Boeing's dividend yield lags behind the market average. With solid growth in its earnings projected for the foreseeable future, when will Boeing share its wealth with shareholders?|Boeing has a history of being conservative with its dividend, keeping it flat during long stretches during the 1990s and early 2000s. The aerospace giant started lifting its payout regularly over the past decade, but the financial crisis led it to hold its dividends steady until the worst of the recession had ended. Now, Boeing appears ready to start a new streak of dividend growth. Let's take a closer look at Boeing to see whether it's likely to keep its young streak going and raise its payout again in early 2014.|Dividend Stats on Boeing|How high can Boeing dividends fly? Boeing shareholders can't seriously complain about a subpar dividend yield, largely because that yield's decline has come from a huge run-up in its share price. Over the past year, Boeing's stock is up almost 90%, and that increase in share price by itself has played a major role in reducing Boeing's dividend yield from the roughly 2.5% level it enjoyed this time last year. Defense peers Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have also enjoyed substantial share price gains, but their returns in the 50% range reflect the fact that they've benefited far less from the civilian side of the business than Boeing has.|Much of Boeing's success has come from the newly found financial health of airlines around the world. Domestically, big players in the airline industry have ridden ancillary fees on baggage and other items to big gains in profits, and they've been anxious to put their cash to work by modernizing their aging fleets and replacing costly older aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient models that can reduce their overall costs. Boeing has done its best to jump on the gold rush in capital expenditures, although rival Airbus has also captured its fair share of orders from the world's airlines.|Boeing continues to make headlines for the wrong reasons, though. Its 787 Dreamliner has kept having numerous technical problems, although recent setbacks have paled in comparison to the battery problems that grounded the aircraft entirely for several months earlier this year. Airlines have been willing to give Boeing the benefit of the doubt, but as problems persist, more prospective buyers could follow the lead of Japan Airlines and give large orders to Airbus in order to express their dissatisfaction.|Still, Boeing hasn't put all its bets on the commercial aerospace industry. The company teamed up with Lockheed Martin on a bid for the next-generation stealth bomber that could bring in $55 billion. Continued budget pressure could make such opportunities few and far between, raising the stakes for Boeing to make sure it capitalizes on them when they arise.|Boeing's 10% dividend increase last year marked an acceleration in the company's dividend growth from its early 2012 increase, and with earnings estimates continuing to rise sharply, Boeing has more room to make further increases without causing cash-flow problems. With the aerospace giant paying just a third of its earnings to shareholders as dividends -- a lower level than either Lockheed Martin or Raytheon -- even a sizable increase wouldn't raise its payout ratio to unacceptable levels.|When will Boeing boost its payout?Just yesterday, Boeing declared its regular fourth-quarter dividend, keeping it at $0.485 per share. That payout will mark its fourth-straight quarter at that level, raising the possibility that Boeing could send its dividend higher early next year.|Another 10% increase to roughly $0.535 per share would still leave Boeing with a payout ratio less than 40%. It would also leave its yield at relatively low levels, but Boeing would need a much higher increase to $0.65 per share just to reach the 2% yield mark at current share prices.|Given Boeing's conservative nature, investors should expect only a more modest increase in its dividend. In the long run, though, continued profit growth could help Boeing start a long streak of dividend growth for long-term investors.|Are Boeing's dividends your best bet?Income investors know that dividend stocks can make you rich.

But the glamorous double-decker jumbo jet that revolutionized air travel and shrunk the globe could be nearing the end of the line.|Boeing has cut its production target twice in six months. Just 18 will be produced in each of the next two years. Some brand-new 747s go into storage as soon as they leave the plant. Counting cancellations, it hadn't sold a single 747 this year until Korean Air bought five last week.|Boeing says it's committed to the 747, and sees a market for it in regions like Asia. But most airlines simply don't want big, four-engine planes anymore. They prefer newer two-engine jets that fly the same distance while burning less fuel.|International travel was mostly limited to those who could afford the pricy flights. The 747 changed that. The first 747s could seat twice as many passengers as the preferred international jet of the time, the Boeing 707. Long flights became more economical for the airlines. Ticket prices fell and soon a summer vacation in Europe was no longer just for the wealthy.|Boeing began building 747s in the late 1960s. Production peaked at 122 in 1990. Overall, Boeing sold a total of 1,418 747s before redesigning the plane in 2011.
