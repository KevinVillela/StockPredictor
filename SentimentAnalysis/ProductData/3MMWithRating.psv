Boeing is also a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reflecting its importance to the American economy. Headquartered in Chicago, the company serves both commercial and military customers in over 150 countries, and is one of the largest U.S. exporters by sales. Boeing's Next-Generation 737 tends to be the world's most popular jet airliner, and most of its other jets are mainstays on airport tarmacs around the world as well.|Founded in 1925, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is the world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, and ranked among the top 50 Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. for 2012. Caterpillar is also a component of both the Dow. Headquartered in Peoria, Ill., Caterpillar traces its roots from the merger of the Holt Manufacturing Company and the C.L. Best Tractor Company. The company has grown through a number of acquisitions over the past decade, including Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi in 2008, Caterpillar Xuzhou and MWM Holding in 2010 and Bucyrus International in 2011. Caterpillar heavy machinery is as common at construction and excavation sites as Boeing's jets are at airports, which makes this a classic battle of land versus air.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)Boeing began paying annual dividends in 1942 but switched to quarterly dividends in 1954, which adds up to a 71-year dividend-paying streak. Caterpillar, on the other hand, had been making dividend payments since 1950s, but ceased during the 1960s and did not resume payments until 1982. This one's an easy win for Boeing.|Winner: Boeing, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak)According to Dividata, Boeing has been increasing its dividend payouts at least once per year since 2004, but the company held its dividends firm between 2010 and 2011. By contrast, Caterpillar's increased its dividend payments at least once every year since 1994, which lets it win the stability crown without any hassles.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Boeing has a better shot at long-term outperformance. Both companies face unique macroeconomic headwinds over the coming decade, but Caterpillar's increasing reliance on mining -- a floundering sector -- and its historical dependence on construction growth are both major drawbacks in a world where construction has stalled and commodity prices have plunged. Despite major defense cutbacks and glitches in the next-gen 787, Boeing still stands to gain from the continued surge in long-distance flights around the world, particularly in regions that are just now beginning to enjoy significant middle-class expansions. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others. Keep your eyes open -- you never know where you might find the next great dividend stock!|

Indeed, that route is somewhat unusual, because while Milan is a large business market, it is underserved because of Alitalia's decision to locate its main hub in Rome instead. This created an opening for Emirates to fill a very large plane (a Boeing 777-300ER) without relying on the connecting volume of its Dubai hub.|United flies Boeing 757s like this one on many international routes.|On the other hand, for lower-volume routes (especially to Europe), U.S. carriers use smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 757 or 767. The 757 typically seats fewer than 200 passengers in an international configuration, whereas most of Emirates' planes have 300 to 500 seats. If a carrier like United can only fill a 757 for an international flight, despite having a large hub at Newark Airport to generate passenger "feed," Emirates doesn't have a prayer of filling a much larger 777.|

By linking the agronomy software of the chemical giant's Pioneer seed division with the farm-equipment maker's wireless-data-transfer architecture, the two want to transform how farmers access data on grain moisture, historical yields, and nutrient deficiencies in their soil so they can know where, when, and how best to plant their seed.|Still, as more farmers adopt these advanced farming technologies, it lowers the bar of resistance. Net farm income is predicted to hit its highest levels in 40 years, making technologically advanced farming equipment like the sort Deere manufactures a lucrative space for growth. Analysts say industrywide sales will grow 3% annually through 2017, with revenues widening at a 5% to 10% pace. The Asia-Pacific region alone is expected to adopt advanced crop-management practices at a compounded annual growth rate of 25% over the next few years. Deere's partnership with DuPont could increase its acceptability.|DuPont has already mapped 20 million acres of farmland in the past year from which it provided 1.5 million acres of variable-rate-seeding prescriptions. While it charges $500 per farm, DuPont plans to boost the price next year after implementing system upgrades, and Monsanto says it will start charging $10 per acre for its precision-planting product.|DuPont's Pioneer division offers crop insurance through PHI, as does Deere through its financial-services arm. Archer-Daniels Midland acquired ADM Crop Risk Services in 2010, which allows it to sell and service policies to farmers, and now that Monsanto has joined the fray, a big data critical mass has formed that can be twisted into a precision financial product.|DuPont Management may try to tackle Monsanto, but it's too late for this troubled Delaware-based conglomerate with identity-confusion and in the midst of splitting apart to copycat Monsanto successfully. Once the largest and leading innovator in seeds in the world, Pioneer gave up its seat over the past decade to Monsanto by virtue of blundering and missed strategic opportunities by DuPont Management. Recall DuPont's first major attempt to develop and commercialise a first-generation genetically-modified seed trait (DuPont OptimumGAP) ended in embarrassing failure. After unsuccessful patent litigation against Monsanto, DuPont has ended up paying Monsanto hundreds of $millions a year in license fees in order to embed Pioneer's otherwise inferior seed-line-up with Monsanto's superior GM traits.|Even with the help of Deere, DuPont will continue to be an also-ran, lagging Monsanto in seeds, and lagging Syngenta in crop protection chemicals.|As a Deere shareholder, we have serious concerns the disreputation of DuPont in agriculture will taint Deere. Witness the colossal DuPont Imprelis consumer product fraud, which has consumed already $1.2 billion in charges against DuPont earnings, with thousands of legal claims still pending in various courts throughout the nation. Ms. Kullman, DuPont Chieftess and her TEAM have commanded and delivered the largest, most costly new product failure and ensuing environmental disaster in 21st century corporate America. Hundreds of thousands of mature landscaping trees have been killed by DuPont's insidiously toxic dandelion lawn treatment, which was marketed deceptively by DuPont Management as "very environmentally friendly", "low impact".|Oh great headline. I had thought that someone was going to squash the GMO seed and have a giant push for organic whole foods, boy was I wrong.

However, this isn't the first time that soft drinks-to-financials conglomerate has invested in an integrated oil company. When Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) to 5.7% in 2008, the energy company was still functioning as an integrated oil and gas major.|Is something similar suspected at Exxon? The question that Fools need to ask is: What exactly did Buffett have in mind when he acquired a stake in ExxonMobil last week? Is something similar expected at Exxon? Let's explore.|For more than a century, the integrated structure of oil and gas companies has been arguably among the most profitable undertakings in any industry. It's no surprise that the hugely successful Standard Oil had to be broken up in 1911 because of an increasingly monopolistic hold within the industry. The seven successor companies -- having evolved under various mergers and acquisitions -- have been highly profitable, too. Among them are ExxonMobil, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , Conoco (before its merger with Phillips to form ConocoPhillips), and the American arm of BP (NYSE: BP) . In short, the integrated structure served the oil and gas business extremely well.|Will Exxon divest its refining arm? The big question now is: Will ExxonMobil divest its refining arm? The company has underperformed the broader markets for the last few years. Despite an increase in production from last year, earnings slipped thanks to disastrous refining margins, thus bringing into question the integrated model. Growth has been an issue. Here how Exxon's total returns compare with the S&P 500 for the past five years:|Traditionally, Exxon has been a good allocator of capital with impressive returns, which is probably what caught Buffett's attention in the first place. However, growth looks limited at this point unless a spinoff is on the cards. I can't see why the markets have been otherwise undervaluing an excellent company.|Getting gassy and exploring new frontiersThrough its acquisition of XTO Energy in 2009, Exxon has natural gas making up 49% of its total reserves. While natural gas may not garner a lot of attention from the market in the short run, global demand for this commodity is huge in the long run. Exxon is also involved in ultra-deepwater exploration activities. But it remains to be seen how profitable they are.|Final thoughtsThe signs are ominous. ExxonMobil could break up. Or it may choose to stay the same. But definitely a spinoff of some sort will unlock the hidden value in both the upstream and downstream divisions. Warren Buffett has already seen one such divestiture while holding ConocoPhillips. The question is: Is he sensing something similar to take place at Exxon? The time seems ripe. The integrated model seems to be dying. Long live the integrated model.|As an ExxonMobil retiree (and still a holder of significan XOM stock) I have a definite interest in the questions you pose.|One note: As a working interest partner in the Kashagan project, ExxonMobil was not really in control of the project timeline or the budget. ExxonMobil typically has progressed large projects efficiently and within budget, though, as with any company, there are exceptions.|And yes, the Kashagan project has earned the notoriety of being the most expensive E&P undertaking in the world. However, ExxonMobil seems to be running into unexpected roadblocks and delays in other major projects as well (which might just be a temporary setback).|Why would ExxonMobil become un-integrated and have its profitability suffer from volatile crude oil prices? As noted in the article, ExxonMobil (formerly Standard Oil) was integrated precisely for that reason and has been consistently profitable ever since. The company takes a very long-term view of profitability.|No doubt, Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it's a great value play, which your own analysis suggests, not because he has some foreknowledge that the management is contemplating a spin off.|It is clear that Buffett invested in ExxonMobil because he thinks it is a great investment but.

For that same amount of money, Buffett then said that could buy all American cropland, plus 16 ExxonMobils (NYSE: XOM) , and still have $1 trillion left over.|A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops -- and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. ExxonMobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.|Buffett's new bet on ExxonMobilIt's curious that ExxonMobil would appear in the 2011 shareholders letter (published in 2012). Just recently, Berkshire Hathaway announced a new, multibillion-dollar position in the energy company.|We obviously don't know if Buffett was sizing up the company in 2012 for an investment. Perhaps he just used it as an example because ExxonMobil was the largest company on the market at the time.|But at any rate, Buffett's now giving gold bugs a benchmark to compare their favorite investment to his most recent investment. Buffett could have easily purchased $3.7 billion of gold. He didn't. He bought Exxon.|Why Buffett bought ExxonWe can only speculate as to why Buffett picked ExxonMobil. Previously, he purchased a sizable stake of ConocoPhillips, an investment that was poorly timed when peaked in 2007.|Being commodity producers, oil companies have few advantages over one another, but as Bloomberg reported, ExxonMobil is one of the best oil discoverers in the world. The company spent just $19.27 to find an equivalent of a barrel, making it the second most efficient oil finder after Chevron. Buffett may believe that to be a durable competitive advantage.|

Today, two of America's largest retailers, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Target (NYSE: TGT) will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeEstablished in 1978, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is the largest home-improvement specialty retailer in the world. The company is also one of only two retailers on the Dow Jones industrial Average, reflecting its importance to the American economy. Home Depot operates more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico catering to both do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM) styles. Home Depot has been one of the fastest-growing retailers, and also one of the best stocks, since its first store opened in 1979.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Home Depot's paid regular quarterly dividends for more than 20 years since initiating payment in 1992. However, Home Depot's 22-year dividend streak can't hold a candle to Target, whose dividend history dates all the way back to 1967. Target's uninterrupted quarterly dividend-streak of 46 years allows it to win the endurance crown without breaking a sweat.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak) Home Depot's dividend payouts held firm between 2006 and 2009, which means that it's only been raising its dividend since 2010. By contrast, Target has been raising its dividend payouts since 1968, which equates to a 45-year long dividend-raising streak, according to dividend.com. This one was even more lopsided than the first contest.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Home Depot has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as the U.S. housing market has barely begun to recover from a once-in-a-lifetime crash. Increasing consumer home-improvement spending and strong housing starts have already fueled a double in Home Depot's shares over the past two years. On the other hand, Target has been expanding its geographical presence as well as product offerings, but it's been crimped by an ongoing retail malaise, and a long-running shift toward online retail has barely begun to impact larger brick-and-mortar retailers.

However, if we use the five-year average P/E ratio for Pfizer, it could be 9.5% undervalued. That's a fairly wide spread and should make you cautious.|Pfizer|And, while J&J investors are paying near historical highs for sales and earnings, it may offer the biggest potential for upside based on my target P/E estimates.

Whereas insurers such as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) and WellPoint (NYSE: WLP) were viewed as potential losers when the PPACA was passed into law, I'm struggling to find a scenario where they don't come out smelling like a rose over the long term.|On one hand, while Obamacare limits UnitedHealth and WellPoint's medical loss ratio at 80%, requiring them to spend at least 80% of their premiums collected on patient care, it does bring in the possibility of millions of new enrollees, which will aid growth over the long run. Conversely, even if Obamacare were to somehow fail, insurers such as WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group had incredible pricing power long before this new health reform law was enacted.|Also, with respect to UnitedHealth, which gets about one-quarter of its business from Medicare Advantage -- a supplemental health insurance plan that helps bridge the costs paid out of pocket by Medicare patients -- it would probably see growth in its Medicare Advantage business no matter which scenario ensues. Put simply, insurers are still on a path to prosperity.|

Today, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) , two companies that have come to symbolize different aspects of the new globalized retail economy, will square off in a head-to-head battle to determine which offers a better dividend for your portfolio.|Tale of the tapeFounded in 1962, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is the world's largest retailer, and ranked as the world's second-largest public corporation on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2013. The company operates more than 11,000 stores under 69 banners in 27 countries, and also maintains e-commerce websites in 10 countries. The Arkansas-based colossus is perhaps more responsible than any other company for changing the way America shops, as its supply chain advancements have helped set the standard for globally-oriented retail operations for decades. However, Wal-Mart has also become a symbol of the purported evils of globalism, as these same supply chain advancements have spurred the growth of sweatshop labor in the developing world while simultaneously crowding smaller local retail enterprises out of many communities.|Founded in 1907, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) is the world's largest package-delivery company by revenue and volume, and is a global supply chain leader, making it an ideal complement to Wal-Mart's retail operations. UPS delivers roughly 1.8 million packages each business day to over 200 countries and territories. and also provides supply chain solutions to customers in over 175 countries and territories. In its last few decades, UPS has expanded enormously through the acquisition of nearly 40 companies, which have included retail shipping services, trucking and air freight, and international trade services.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)Wal-Mart is one of investors' favorite dividend stocks because it's paid uninterrupted dividends for a period of 39 years since initiating payment in 1974. That's an easy win for Wal-Mart over UPS, which only began paying quarterly dividends in 1999, according to Dividata.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 1-0.|Round two: stability (dividend-raising streak)According to Dividata, UPS has been increasing its dividend at least once per year since 2010, after holding steady in 2009 during the global financial crisis. On the other hand, Wal-Mart has raised its dividend payments every year since 1975, which works out to 38-year dividend-raising streak. This is even more lopsided in Wal-Mart's favor than the first contest.|Winner: Wal-Mart, 2-0.|Bonus round: opportunities and threats Wal-Mart may have won the best-of-five on the basis of its history, but investors should never base their decisions on past performance alone. Tomorrow might bring a far different business environment, so it's important to also examine each company's potential, whether it happens to be nearly boundless or constrained too tightly for growth.|One dividend to rule them all In this writer's humble opinion, it seems that Wal-Mart has a better shot at long-term outperformance, as its aggressive expansion plans in emerging markets have helped offset domestic weakness. However, the company's once-indomitable supply chain advantage has eroded, and a shift to online retail could ultimately tip UPS into the lead as more consumers decide that they'd rather have their purchases delivered from a nearby warehouse instead of bagged up at a checkout line. You might disagree, and if so, you're encouraged to share your viewpoint in the comments below. No dividend is completely perfect, but some are bound to produce better results than others. Keep your eyes open -- you never know where you might find the next great dividend stock!|

Kristen Bentz, executive director at private equity firm PMG Venture Group, told CNN she believes this may be the case, as middle-class consumers continue to deal with a decline in purchasing power.|Mike Duke, Wal-Mart's president and CEO, stated that while the current retail environment remains competitive, the company has aggressive plans to increase holiday sales. Economic uncertainty is a headwind for the business and Duke believes "some customers feel uncertainty about the economy, government [and] job stability."|The slow growth is expected to continue into the first month of the fourth quarter.

The big-box retailer has announced it will open at 6:00pm on Thanksgiving, two hours earlier than last year, in order to boost consumer traffic and sales revenue. The retailer will remain open throughout the evening and into Black Friday since over 4,000 of their U.S. stores are regularly open 24 hours. In addition, Wal-Mart will offer special deals on must-have items this holiday season through their website beginning Thanksgiving morning. This newest Thanksgiving strategy of offering deals even earlier than usual may seem like a win-win for Wal-Mart, but its competitors are also gearing up for the holiday season. Plus, more time to shop on Thanksgiving does not guarantee that consumers will spend more than their wallets will allow.|It's going to be a nuclear arms raceWal-Mart's actions will not be taken lightly by competitors. Once one retailer makes a bold sales move to draw attention and traffic its way, other retailers must respond in a similar fashion. This move by Walmart to open doors earlier on Thanksgiving, increasing its number of popular items on hand, and starting sales promotions a month earlier on-line will force its competitors to modify their strategy in each of these areas. Wal-Mart's move has started what some may call an "arms race." Retailers are going to closely take note of what the others are doing, mimicking every move by their competitors in order to remain strong on the battlefield. Since the holiday season is six days shorter than last year, retailers are worried that less shopping time for consumers could result in a decrease in sales. Retailers, like Wal-Mart, are pulling out all the stops to not let this holiday season be a letdown.|This means war!Like Wal-Mart, its competitors are also opening doors earlier on Thanksgiving. BestBuy will open its doors at the same time as Wal-Mart in an attempt to lure consumers towards their assortment of electronics. Target, Macy's (NYSE: M) , Kohl's, and J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) will open their doors at 8:00 pm on Thanksgiving. For Macy's and JC Penny, this is their first time being open on Thanksgiving. Macy's and JC Penny had to make this change if they plan on having any sort of sales victory, especially in J.C. Penney's case. Like J.C. Penney, Sears is also hurting sales-wise at both Sears and Kmart. Hoping to recover and make up for lost ground, Sears plans to kick-off Black Friday sales before all the rest by opening all Kmarts' doors at 6:00 am on Thanksgiving. Not only are retailers' opening their doors earlier than in past years, but they also have sales promotions scheduled to run hours, days, and weeks up until Thanksgiving and through the Black Friday weekend.|Sales promotions and hot-ticket items available for consumers have increased this holiday season. Wal-Mart, in fact, has already released its online annual sales promotions, hoping to generate holiday sales a month earlier. In addition, Wal-Mart will have 65% more televisions available to purchase, along with twice as many tablet computers and an additional 17 must-have consumer products on display throughout the store. Wal-Mart will release special deals on these items at different times throughout the evening on Thanksgiving and into Black Friday. Like Wal-Mart, Target is advertising a special daily promotion starting two weeks before Thanksgiving, whereas Best Buy and Kohl's plan to offer online deals for a few days|No retailer is expected to boost revenues by that much this year. For instance, Wal-Mart is expected to increase revenues by 3% year over year, and Best Buy is expected to actually experience a 10.4% decrease in revenues from the same quarter last year. Other retailers like Kohl's, Target, and J.C. Penney are not looking any better than last holiday season, with Kohl's seeing an estimated decrease in revenues of -2.6%, Target by -1.3%, and J.C. Penney increasing revenues by less than half a percent. As far as earnings per share goes, analysts expect Best Buy to increase EPS by $0.11, with the other retailers gaining or losing a negligible $0.02 to $0.04 per share. However, for J.C. Penney, analysts expect the company to lose $0.91 per share, which is better than last fourth quarter when they lost $1.95 per share. For J.C. Penney, this holiday season is their make it or break it quarter.|

Monsanto, DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Syngenta (NYSE: SYT) all provide the one major purchased component that all crop farmers need: seeds with which to grow their crops. Beyond the planting, there is plenty of discrepancy on the other inputs from pesticides to fertilizers, but the seed is the one absolute investment requirement for crop farmers.|Monsanto's contributions came late, but have since spurred a second agricultural revolution. The commercialization of Roundup herbicide in 1976 and the subsequent introduction of Roundup Ready Soybeans twenty years later changed the playing field. Monsanto's Roundup Ready Seeds and the Pioneer Hi-Bred products now owned by DuPont were created in response to farmer demand, with farmers seeking to get the highest yields from their crops. Seeds have since become an absolute consumable, and farmers' dependence on Roundup translated into Monsanto seeds being a no-brain decision.|Why Monsanto is making a climate move Increasing crop productivity is Monsanto's (and DuPont's and Syngenta's) business. Like the productivity-increasing agriculture products of the twentieth century, Monsanto sees the weather-predicting prowess of The Climate Corporation as not only a tool to help increase crop productivity, but also as a business capable of producing substantial annual returns. Monsanto may be taking what looks like a huge $1 billion risk on the acquisition, but the move makes complete sense if one looks closer at what Monsanto has been developing beyond just seeds and pesticides.|Sunny skies ahead Monsanto is mostly alone in taking a direct approach to address the effects of climate conditions on agricultural productivity. Syngenta and DuPont create and are developing products to withstand extreme environments, but Monsanto's investment to provide farmers with tools that may reduce weather-related risks is a direct and forward-looking approach that will pay off for Monsanto.|

To answer this question, I delved into its earnings report and compared it to Home Depot.|Lowe's vs. Home DepotThis week, Home Depot also reported earnings. Much to Mr. Market's surprise, the company earned $0.95 per share, 5.6% higher than the $0.90 that analysts expected and substantially higher than the $0.63 it earned last year. The increase in the company's bottom line came about as a result of revenue increasing 7.4% (due to an increase in comparable-store sales of 7.4%) combined with greater cost savings.|For the quarter, Home Depot saw its COGS decline from 65.4% of sales to 65.1%. On top of this improvement, it also experienced a substantial decline in its SG&A expenses, which fell from 22.8% of sales to 21%. Additionally, investors benefited from 81 million fewer shares outstanding, without which earnings per share would have fallen inline with analyst expectations.|Foolish takeawayLooking at the performance of both Lowe's and Home Depot, we can see that neither company appears to be performing poorly.

Regular Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero increased volume 4% and 23% respectively. Other Coca-Cola flavors, a category that include Vanilla Coke and Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, increased volume 10%. Marketing campaigns such as the "Share-a-Coke" program where people can purchase a can of Coke with their name as well as the "Coke with Meals" program where Coca-Cola products gets marketed with food, in addition to temporarily favorable weather conditions in the month of July contributed greatly to the volume increases.|European economy remains poorDespite an improving GDP, Coca-Cola Enterprises faces tough macroeconomic headwinds in the form of continued high unemployment and a cash strapped consumer that wants to sit on their wallet. The ravages of the various sovereign debt crises and a steep recession still remain on the minds of the European populace.

Regardless of the negative sentiment by Coca-Cola Enterprises' executives and the market in general, evidence points to pockets of recovery in Europe. Eventually European unemployment will begin to trend downward resulting in increased consumer spending.

Negative headwinds from Aspartame concerns and the general downtrend in carbonated sodas weighed in on the company. Overall, reported sales increased 1% on the basis of price with overall sales volume declining 1% in the most recent quarter. The five tidbits listed below will help you understand Dr. Pepper Snapple Group's current direction amid towering competition from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) .|Reported top-line growth for the big three beverage companies ranked in the dismal range. Coca-Cola's revenue actually declined 3% in its most recent quarter. Its global sparkling volume expanded a mere 1% versus 3% for non-carbonated beverages. Currency headwinds and restructurings further contributed to Coca-Cola's woes. According to fellow Fool Ted Cooper , Coca-Cola commands more than 40% of the carbonated soda market in North America meaning it still maintains a huge ubiquitous advantage over the other two companies and commands great pricing and distribution power. Coca-Cola is also moving forward with expansion plans in emerging markets.|

In these licensed territories, Coca-Cola Enterprises provides Coca-Cola, Fanta, Capri-Sun, Schweppes, Dr Pepper, Monster, Relentless, and PowerAde. What's interesting about Coca-Cola Enterprises's third-quarter performance is that the volume numbers appear to be moving in the opposite direction from industry trends for sparkling and still beverages, but there's a reason for this.|Recent resultsPrior to going over recent volume performance, it should be noted that the rise of the health-conscious consumer has led to declining demand for sparkling beverages (soda). Also thanks to the rise of the health-conscious consumer, demand for still beverages (juices, ready-to-drink teas, etc.) has increased. However, that wasn't the case for Coca-Cola Enterprises in the third quarter.|In the third quarter, volume increased 2.5% year over year, with sparkling beverage volume popping 4% and still beverage volume sliding 5%. Coca-Cola trademark beverage brand volume jumped 5%, with strong growth in Coca-Cola Classic, Coca-Cola Zero, Cherry Coke Zero, and Vanilla Coke. A lot of this success has to do with Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) status as a marketing juggernaut.|It doesn't seem to matter what headwinds are thrown at Coca-Cola. It will find a way to offset those headwinds. For instance, Coca-Cola's "Share a Coke" program has been a continued success and its international potential is still in its infant stages. If you would like an example of the "Share a Coke" program, you can watch this short video: http://youtu.be/5l0cCyElfgg|Even the CIA is helping Coca-Cola. No ... undercover spies aren't tapping into phones and watching potential customers with night-vision goggles. This is a different CIA -- the Culinary Institute of America. Researchers at this CIA help determine what meals best complement Coca-Cola. This information is then passed on to certain quick-service and full-service restaurants. The idea here is to enhance the customer experience for these restaurants. While many consumers have a beverage of choice, others will select a drink based on their mood. This program can help lead customers in the right direction in order to maximize their meal experience.|Still beverages should bounce back, and Coca-Cola has proven that it has the capability to drive demand for sparkling beverages with its marketing power. This is a positive for Coca-Cola Enterprises. There is also good potential in emerging markets as these consumers aren't as health-conscious as Americans. At least not yet.|While Coca-Cola Enterprises is a quality operation, it lags PepsiCo on the top line, it comes up short of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo at turning revenue into profit, and its yield isn't quite as impressive as Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.|When you compare Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, as always, it seems like somewhat of a wash. While PepsiCo is performing better on the top line, Coca-Cola is more impressive in profit margin, yield, and debt-to-equity ratio. However, debt isn't really a concern for any of these companies, since they generate so much cash.

However, this wasn't always the case. The company, which was founded in 1923, began as a small operation that would eventually transform into the giant that it is today. To celebrate the company's standing as the creme de la creme of media, I thought it only fitting to write an article about three things you probably didn't know about it.|Walt was wrong; it didn't start with a mouseMost people who are fans of Disney will likely recall Walt Disney's famous saying: "I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing-that it was all started by a mouse". Although it is true that the company's early success came about as a result of the introduction of Mickey Mouse, it's far from true that Disney's work started with the mouse.|Disney had a predecessorPrior to starting Disney, Walt set up and ran another animation studio. In 1922, Walt founded Laugh-O-Gram Films with an initial $15,000 investment. Their primary function was to produce fairy tale cartoons for Pictorial Clubs. Despite this profitable contract, which brought in $11,000 for the studio, the company struggled to pay its bills. In 1923 it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the collapse of Pictorial Clubs.|However, before the studio was shut down Laugh-O-Gram successfully produced two other projects; Tommy Tucker's Tooth and Alice's Wonderland. The first film talked about the virtues of brushing your teeth and the negative consequences if you don't care for them properly. The second film, Alice's Wonderland, came about as a result of Walt reinvesting the $500 he had made from Tommy Tucker's Tooth. It was this second film that would lead to the earliest commercial success for Disney's Alice Comedies.|The original location of Laugh-O-Gram, which is located in Kansas City, Missouri and which served as the birthplace of Mickey Mouse, fell into disrepair after many years. However, in recent years a non-profit group named "Thank You, Walt Disney" in collaboration with Disney has worked to restore the building and turn it into a museum and education center focusing on animation.|

At the same time, a few energy giants including ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) , BP (NYSE: BP) , and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) , have sold off billions in assets and now suddenly find themselves flush with cash.|Not surprisingly, investors have taken notice and are pressuring energy companies for bigger cash returns. It's understandable after all, since underlying results from these three have suffered this year due to extremely poor refining results, supply disruptions overseas, and in BP's case, mounting legal fees. ExxonMobil, BP, and ConocoPhillips will return billions in cash to shareholders, which means their investors will win big.|Billions in cash from asset salesExxonMobil, BP, and ConocoPhillips are each raising billions in cash from selling assets deemed non-critical to their core strategic priorities. ExxonMobil recently announced it would sell its stake in a Hong Kong power-generation company for more than $3 billion. The cash injection couldn't come at a better time for ExxonMobil, which saw profits fall 31% year-to-date, as the company suffers from extremely poor refining results.|A possible use of funds: returning cash to shareholdersExxonMobil, BP, and ConocoPhillips have encountered various difficulties this year, but shareholders haven't abandoned their desire for cash. And, as industry profits wobble due to the pressures of poor refining and falling oil prices, Big Oil is scrambling to produce cash to finance greater cash returns.|For example, ExxonMobil has historically spent tens of billions per year in buying back its own stock. ExxonMobil bought back $3 billion worth of its own shares in the most recent quarter. Also, ExxonMobil pays a 2.9% dividend, which the company has increased for 31 years in a row.|The bottom lineExxonMobil saw profits fall considerably to start the year due to an extremely poor environment for refining. BP has spent billions in fines and damages stemming from the 2010 Gulf Spill. At the same time, ConocoPhillips sees more value in boosting cash returns to shareholders than holding onto non-critical assets in risky locations of the world.|These three energy giants have turned to asset sales to solve their respective problems, as well as continue to satisfy their investors' insatiable hunger for yield. While it's important that ExxonMobil, BP, and ConocoPhillips sort out their underlying issues to ensure future profits, all this new cash means investors are being paid very well to wait for better days to come.|

My conclusion was that the energy supermajor's "return on capital remains well in excess of [its] cost of capital" and that it "does not need to deliver the same returns it has produced since 1970 (a better than 375-fold total return) in order to provide investors with a more than adequate return during the next 40 years."|This morning, research firm Morningstar published a detailed analysis supporting its decision to continue awarding a "wide moat" rating to ExxonMobil -- the only such rating among the oil and gas producers it covers (a "wide moat" refers to long-term competitive advantage -- a key source of excess returns). The full report, which can be found here, is required reading if you own or are considering buying ExxonMobil shares, but I've highlighted some of the key points below.|Chanos argued ExxonMobil a "value trap" on the basis that:|In terms of the integrated oil companies, the business demonstrably has gotten worse and it's for a simple reason: the cost of finding and replacing reserves has gone up. Let's just use Exxon as an example. Their revenues are down year-over-year yet the amount of capital they've employed in the business continues to grow.|Like its peers, Exxon has seen its F&D [finding & development] costs rise during the past 10 years. However, relative to commodity prices and measured against peers, Exxon remains highly competitive. F&D costs for Exxon have remained relatively stable during the past 10 years despite increasing in absolute terms. If we look at Exxon's F&D as a percentage of oil prices, it has actually fallen.|However, that measure ignores the shift toward natural gas in the reserve base. Measuring F&D as part of revenue per barrel of oil equivalent of production, however, takes into account the shift to natural gas as percentage of reserves and production during the past 10 years. By that measure, Exxon still appears competitive, suggesting it should continue delivering excess returns on capital in its upstream segment... Compared with peers, Exxon continues to replace reserves at a competitive cost. In fact, it has registered improvement since 2009.|Exxon's low cost of capital plays a part in its wide moat rating. Although not the lowest of its peer group, it still provides a low hurdle rate to earn excess returns. Combined with higher returns on capital, Exxon generates greater excess returns. This wide spread between returns on invested capital and the weighted average cost of capital, or the size of the excess returns relative to peers', gives us confidence in Exxon's ability to generate excess returns for 20 years, earning it a wide moat. The magnitude of peers' excess returns is less, providing less of a margin of safety and earning them only narrow moats.|That paragraph reads like a ringing endorsement of Buffett's decision to add ExxonMobil to Berkshire's portfolio and the one to reduce the existing ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) position. However, I should note that Morningstar currently rates ExxonMobil as a three-star stock, which, according to their methodology, indicates that the current stock price is close to their fair value estimate and that the stock "should offer a "fair return," one that compensates for the riskiness of the stock." The Oracle of Omaha likes to make investments in the expectation that they will earn a return that's more than fair, but, given the size of Berkshire's portfolio, "fair" would hardly be a shameful result.|
