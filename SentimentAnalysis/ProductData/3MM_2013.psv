The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, growth in earnings per share, solid stock price performance and expanding profit margins. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.|3M CO has improved earnings per share by 7.9% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, 3M CO increased its bottom line by earning $6.31 versus $5.96 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($6.68 versus $6.31).|47.60% is the gross profit margin for 3M CO which we consider to be strong. Regardless of MMM's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, MMM's net profit margin of 15.53% compares favorably to the industry average.

The company has revised down its sales' outlook for 2013 from $56-$58 billion to $55 billion; for 2014 the company expects sales to remain flat. Cummins' revenues slightly rose by 4% in the third quarter but didn't meet the market expectations .|Cummins, much likeCaterpillar, revised its outlook downward. It estimates its revenues will decline by 3% year over year in 2013, rather than remaining flat as previously estimated. In the first nine months of 2013, the company's revenues fell by 2.5%, suggesting the fourth quarter may show an even steeper drop in sales.|The chart above shows that Joy Global's operating profit is nearly three times that of Caterpillar. Even if the company's profitability were to decline, it would still remain high for the industry. This high profitability also means high free cash flow.|Joy Global's enterprise value and its EV-to-EBITDA ratio were compared to Caterpillar, Cummins and the average Machinery industry. This will provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation for Joy Global's valuation.|Based on the above, Joy Global's EV-to-EBITDA ratio of only 6 is the lowest of the three companies, even falling below the industry average. In comparison, Caterpillar's EV-to- EBITDA ratio is 9.89, which is close to the industry average.

http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/10/30/is-caterpillars-dividend-streak-in-jeopardy.aspx|10/30/2013|1|"Caterpillar Inc"|0|Is Caterpillar's Dividend Streak in Jeopardy?|Caterpillar's (NYSE: CAT) fortunes have soared over the past 20 years, as the rise of emerging economies creating brand-new markets for the heavy-equipment manufacturer. Those opportunities helped Caterpillar become a dividend giant, establishing a 20-year track record of annual payout increases that has boosted its quarterly dividend more than 30-fold over that time frame. But now that Caterpillar's earnings have fallen substantially, dividend investors need to watch to make sure the stock's payout remains secure.|The same trends that helped Caterpillar rise so sharply since the early 1990s are now creating challenges for the company, as sluggish construction and infrastructure activity in China and the rest of the emerging market world has weighed on its growth prospects. At the same time, plunging commodity prices have led to problems for Caterpillar as well as mining equipment specialist Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) and engine producer Cummins (NYSE: CMI) , which supplies motors for excavators and other mining equipment. With Caterpillar expecting weak earnings into the future, will the double hit from construction and mining force the heavy-equipment giant to rein in its dividend growth? Let's take a closer look at Caterpillar to see how healthy its dividend looks right now.|Dividend Stats on Caterpillar|Why Caterpillar has some breathing room Caterpillar has treated long-term investors well, with solid share price gains adding to its steadily growing dividend. But more recently, Caterpillar's stock has dropped substantially since early 2012, ever since the slowdown in the Chinese economy really took hold. The equipment maker has been among the worst performers in the Dow, losing ground even as the broader stock market has climbed to record-high levels.|Caterpillar's third-quarter results reveal most of the construction equipment giant's challenges. Net income plunged by 44% on an 18% pullback in revenue, and the company cut its earnings guidance for the full year. That's consistent with the results that Joy Global gave, with a 42% drop in bookings coming from its underground mining segment, and Cummins also blamed mining for its earnings miss and guidance cut. Yet even outside mining, tough conditions have weighed on results, as Deere (NYSE: DE) recently reported an 11% drop in revenue for its construction and forestry segment and expects further declines for the full 2013 year.|Still, the hope for Caterpillar is that once conditions start to improve in key markets like China, it could end up recovering more quickly than Deere or Joy Global. One reason for optimism is that Caterpillar is still working hard to keep its margins up, staring down weak demand by nevertheless imposing price increases on most of its machine line for next year. That sort of long-term perspective separates Caterpillar from less experienced companies that might be tempted to offer discounts to counter flagging sales.|Caterpillar hasn't let its recent struggles stop it from delivering exceptional dividend growth, with a 15% increase in its July dividend payment marking the second straight double-digit percentage rise for Caterpillar's payout. Deere and Cummins boast an even stronger track record over the past few years, but neither they nor Joy Global has demonstrated the long-term commitment to shareholders to deliver consistent dividend increases over time.|When will Caterpillar boost its payout?Because the Dividend Aristocrats look at annual payouts rather than quarterly ones in determining streaks of increases, Caterpillar's mid-year dividend increase in July actually gives it the ability to wait until 2015 for its next boost without jeopardizing its streak. Based on past experience during troubled times, Caterpillar might well take advantage of that latitude to shore up its earnings and prevent its payout ratio from getting too high. That might not make dividend investors happy, but in the long run, it should lead to more sustainable payouts for Caterpillar that could prevent a more disruptive dividend cut down the line.|Is Caterpillar the best dividend stock out there?Caterpillar looks like it should keep its dividend intact for now, although not everyone would agree about its long-term prospects. Still, there's one thing most investors can agree on: Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine.

With earnings down over 40% in the third quarter, that would seem an understatement. Since this year is a bust, the big question is what happens in 2014?|Mining the problemsCaterpillar has invested heavily in the mining industry. The logic behind the choice is sound. Mining equipment is heavily used, thus requiring frequent replacement. And there is a big market for parts, which wear out quickly because of near constant use. This suggests a robust new equipment market and a growing parts business, which provides a relatively stable recurring income stream.|However, Caterpillar's timing hasn't been so good. Over the last year or so the mining industry has been in triage mode. That's why the company's Resource Industries segment, which sells to miners, accounted for 75% of Caterpillar's third quarter shortfall. While other business lines have been weak, too, until the mining industry starts to rebound, performance will likely remain subpar.|Cutting backCaterpillar has been cutting back, reducing expenses by $700 million and cutting capital expenditures by some $400 million. This has included trimming its payroll by 13,000 employees over the past year. The company, however, isn't the only one working on cost savings, which is why 2014 isn't likely to see much of an improvement over 2013.|Another part of the problem for Caterpillar, however, is that BHP Billiton is also focusing on increasing its productivity. For example, the company has increased its 2014 iron ore guidance by five million tonnes because of the "deployment of mobile crushing units and the continued de-bottlenecking of the supply chain." Although a portion of this increase was the result of an investment in equipment, longer-term productivity improvements reduce the need for new equipment even though the company is pulling more product out of the ground.|Until supply and demand come back into balance, capital spending in the mining industry is likely to remain weak. BHP and Teck are just two examples of the cost cutting trend. But the pair highlights the long-term nature of the issue. This means that Caterpillar's mining sales will remain a weak spot.|That said, the capital spending pullback can only last so long. Watch the financial results and spending patterns at big miners like BHP, Teck, and Peabody Energy for a sign of things to come at Caterpillar. Caterpillar's business isn't likely to pick up until after the miners see an uptick, however, so don't expect 2014 to be much better than 2013.

The ACCORD-Lipid trial showed that triglyceride levels improved when patients were given AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) Tricor, but the drug had no effect on adverse cardiovascular events. Another trial, called AIM-HIGH -- testing the organic compound niacin like what's in AbbVie's Niaspan -- also failed to show better outcomes for patients taking the drug. Merck (NYSE: MRK) had a similar result with its niacin-containing Cordaptive; the drug failed to improve outcomes despite improving both triglyceride and cholesterol levels.|But even with the SPA still in place, the FDA was obviously against the expanded authorization, and after a substantially negative advisory panel meeting Amarin already had no shot at getting Vascepa approved. Pulling the SPA is just the last nail in the coffin. It doesn't change anything because Vascepa's chances for expanded approval were already killed by the trials run on AbbVie's and Merck's drugs.|Buying opportunity?Amarin still has a chance to expand the use of Vascepa into patients with moderately high triglyceride levels if the outcomes trial is positive. Vascepa works in a different way than AbbVie's Tricor and Niaspan and Merck's Cordaptive, so it's conceivable that Vascepa could improve outcomes even though the others didn't. Unfortunately, the trial won't read out until late 2015 at the earliest and could take until 2017 if Amarin has to wait for the final results.

Yet saturation becomes a worry at some point, not to mention the fact that the company is heavily weighted toward shoes. So why invest in a slow growth shoe company when you can invest in the fast growing apparel market?|Under Armour (NYSE: UA) is a smaller, and much more nimble company than Nike. It gets about 70% of revenue from apparel, with nearly 20% from footwear. During Q2, Under Armour's revenues in both North America and internationally went up big; North America revenue rose nearly 23% year-over-year, while international revenue was up 25%.|Wearables creates an opportunityOne of the big opportunities for Under Armour lies in the fact that the "wearables" market remains wide open. Nike has its well-known Fuel band, but Under Armour has yet to make a big splash in this market, though that may well be about to change. Take Under Armour's Tech shirt for example, which has the technology for reading heart rates, and other info, built directly into the shirt.|Another one of Under Armour's big splashes in the wearable tech market is its Armour 39, which is a heart rate monitor chest strap for athletes that even claims to measure willpower. As mentioned, Nike's most compelling offering in the wearable space is its Fuel band. If the success of this device is any indication of how popular wearables are, then Under Armour investors should be very excited. For fiscal 2012, Nike's equipment segment (which includes the Fuel band) profits jumped 18% year over year. In fiscal 2011, this segment saw a 1% decline in profits year over year.|In addition to Nike, Under Armour could see increased competition from Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) , which is another up-and-coming activewear maker. Lulu is currently heavily weighted toward the women's business in the U.S. While the company is trying to break into the men's activewear market, it still has a long way to go. Both Lulu and Under Armour, however, trade with forward P/E ratios above Nike. Lulu has a price to earnings ratio of 40, Under Armour is at 65, while Nike is at 26. . So, Nike is the cheapest, but it's expected to grow earnings per share the lowest of the three, at only 12.7% annualized over the next five years. Compare this to Lulu's 18.7% and Under Armour's 21%.|The company should be one of investors' focuses when looking for strong growth stocks. Meanwhile Nike's growth story has already played out, and Lulu still has much to prove, including if it can break into men's apparel.

Today it's different. Companies like Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA) have such strong brands and loyalty that customers already know what they want. The end result is that they can buy directly from Nike or Under Armour without having to go to their local sporting goods store. This trend is bad news for companies like Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS).|The top sportswear and apparel companyNike remains the top dog in the sportswear and athletic footwear market worldwide. To remain the top dog, Nike continues to innovate and expand its product offerings. One area where Nike looks to get ahead of its competition is in wearable devices. Nike's new Fuelband SE is an update of its original Fuelband with some major improvements.|What I like about the new Fuelband SE is that it has Bluetooth 4.0, which allows it to be synced with the Fuelband app on iPhone or Android. The device comes with smarter motion sensors that improve fitness tracking. Nike is going to sell the device for $149, and it hits shelves in November.|At Nike's 2013 Investor Meeting, CEO Mark Parker was very optimistic about the company's prospects going forward. Nike forecasts strong sales gains in apparel, its women's line, and e-commerce. By 2017, apparel sales are forecast to grow from $7.5 billion to $10 billion. Its women's business is expected to almost double to $7 billion from $4 billion. E-commerce sales are forecast to grow to $2 billion, and total sales are forecast to grow to $36 billion by 2017.|Still a lot of armour in this companyWhile smaller than Nike, Under Armour has made great progress in the sportswear and apparel market. Under Armour just reported earnings that came in $0.02 better than expectations. Revenue grew 26% Y/Y. Net income grew 27% compared to the third quarter of last year. Under Armour is still growing rapidly, and for the full year, the company expects total revenues to grow 26% compared to last year.|In many ways, Under Armour is copying the pages from Nike's playbook. The company has endorsement deals with several notable athletes, including Michael Phelps, Bryce Harper and Cam Newton. In addition, Under Armour is now in the athletic shoe business, and its shoes are catching on with a younger generation.|Foolish assessmentWhile I like shopping at Dick's stores, I just feel that the growth is no longer there. Even though Dick's has an online presence, I feel that more consumers are going to be purchasing their apparel needs directly from Nike and Under Armour. While Dick's does have the Nike and Under Armour shop-within-a-shops at its stores, consumer shopping preferences are changing, and many prefer buying direct from the source. I see this having a much greater impact on Dick's over the long run.|Both Nike and Under Armour are continuing to innovate, and there remains tremendous growth for both companies overseas. Populations are growing much faster overseas, particularly in Asia, and the demand is there for sportswear and apparel worn by people's favorite athletes. Both companies are growing in the double-digits, and I see that trend continuing.

Its blockbuster cholesterol-fighting agent, Lipitor -- formerly the world's top-selling drug -- lost its patent in late 2011. Whole sales were down 29% from one year ago, but the drug still beat expectations by $55 million for earnings of $533 million. Viagra, Pfizer's perhaps more infamous drug, battled generics in Europe less successfully with a 11% decrease in sales this quarter; it is still under patent in the U.S. Generic drugs for Effexor, Zoloft, and Detrol also continued to dig away at sales.|As for current sales, Pfizer's cancer drugs skyrocketed 24% this quarter to $407 million in revenue, and the oncology unit is certainly one of Pfizer's strongest. Part of this surge can be attributed to several new cancer agents. New lung cancer drug Xalkori reported a 92% increase in revenue, and kidney cancer drug Inlyta had a 186% increase in revenue.|Pfizer's pipeline is also quite impressive, with several trial results expected in the next few months and 76 treatments formally in the pipeline. Notable phase 3 agents include breast cancer therapy palbociclid, cholesterol agent bococizumab, diabetes drug ertugliflozin, and pain therapy tanezumab.|Prevnar, Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine, was approved in Europe for adults and expects further study results early next year. Eliquis, an anti-thombotic currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, has yet to see sales take off, but is seeking FDA approval for use in deep vein thrombosis. Menopause therapy Duavee was approved by the FDA and will hit markets in early 2014.|Merck's pipeline is also weaker than Pfizer's, and its strongest agent is perhaps cancer treatment MK3475, a PD-1 agent in direct competition with agents also in development by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche. The company is also undergoing major restructuring, with a wave of 8,500 layoffs currently in the works.|Bottom LinePatent expirations are a common problem with all of these drug giants, and each company has worked to identify a saving grace. Pfizer enjoys a very strong oncology unit, a filled pipeline of late-stage potential blockbusters, and strong sales of its patent-protected agents. It also has implemented a new structure of three units: proprietary pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and generic drugs.

Proposed rate cuts for next year caused an insurer panic earlier this year. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, backed away from its proposed 2% rate cut and instead plans a 3% increase.|But that rate increase is still lower than in previous years, which is why UnitedHealth's saying that rates will contribute to the company adjusting its 2014 guidance during its investor conference in January.|Why's Medicaid included in the table? That government-backed program is also undergoing Obamacare changes. States were given the choice to participate in a Medicaid expansion program that would've widened the umbrella to include low-income people who currently have an income too high to qualify. More patients leads to more profit potential for insurers. And UnitedHealth has more exposure to Medicaid than Medicare Advantage.|Foolish final thoughtsWill Medicare Advantage cuts constrict UnitedHealth in 2014? Sure -- but not as much as competing insurers such as Humana, which have more exposure. UnitedHealth is more dependent on the Medicaid expansion and the outcomes of its private exchange performance, since the company's only dipping a toe into the federal exchange.|All of the insurers face a bumpy path under Obamacare as everything falls into place. So expect a lot of readjustments for the near future. But investors can tune into UnitedHealth's investor day on Jan. 15 for a better idea of what the company sees as its future.

By now you have surely heard this formulaic phrase countless times to describe any number of investment opportunities in the emerging markets. Often these phrases can mean very little, but occasionally they can mean everything. Case in point: Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica (NASDAQOTH: WMMVY) literally translates to "Wal-Mart of Mexico and Central America."|The Wal-Mart of Mexico and Central AmericaWal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica traces its origins back to 1958, but in its present form it began as a 1991 joint venture to open Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs stores in Mexico. Today this Mexican Stock Exchange-traded company is 70% owned by Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , and its operations now include the Central American nations of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. All together, Wal-Mart de Mexico has 2,768 stores in a region that encompasses more than 155 million people.|Of the 2,786 store locations in these six countries, 251 are Wal-Mart stores and 167 are Sam's Clubs. The remaining 2,350 stores are comprised of various brands of discount department stores, discount warehouses, membership warehouse clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies, and clothing apparel stores. Wal-Mart de Mexico's operations also include Banco Wal-Mart with its over one million Mexican bank accounts, as well as its major e-commerce presence with Walmart.com.mx and Mexico's leading online grocery sales site Superama.com.mx.|Mexico The Mexican division of Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica is the much larger of the two, making up about 86% of total company revenue and 76% of the company's store count. The Mexican division is also the largest retailer in Mexico, far larger than its nearest Mexican competitor. This past quarter the Mexican division contributed 87.2 billion pesos ($6.76 billion USD) in revenue, while Mexico's No. 2 retailer -- Organizacion Soriana -- did just 799 million pesos ($62 million USD) during its most recently reported quarter.|Despite this dominance over Mexican retail, Mexico has been a recent challenge for Wal-Mart de Mexico due to the slowdown in that country's economy. In the first and second quarters of this year, the Mexican economy grew just 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the first quarter 2012 and second quarter 2012 growth of 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively. This low Mexican GDP growth can similarly be observed in Wal-Mart de Mexico's third quarter earnings released last week; the Mexican division's revenue increased only 1.7% over its third quarter 2012 revenue.|Central AmericaWhile the Mexican side of Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica has been a challenge as of late, Central America remains an attractive market with great growth potential. The company expanded into Central America in 2010, and this region of nearly 40 million people currently has just 19 Wal-Mart stores and exactly zero Sam's Club locations. As a point of comparison, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona with their combined population of 34.7 million people have 549 Wal-Mart stores and 97 Sam's Clubs locations (as well as two Supermercados).|Much of Central America's retail sector can be described as informal. These are small, local, independent retailers with no real size, scale, or widespread distribution. In other words, this is a rather inefficient retail market ready and waiting for some company to come in, disrupt, and consolidate. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the single best positioned company to be that disruptor.|Foolish bottom lineInvesting in Latin America is not without its risks. That has been particularly true this year, with many Latin American economies slowing down and falling out of investor favor. With shares down over 20% year to date, Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica is no exception. Despite this, there are still great opportunities to be had in Latin America. For those investors able to think long term, the future rewards of Wal-Mart de Mexico could very well be worth the risks of today.|Don't forget about Wal-Mart's fantastic dividendDividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn.

Pageviews-per-user is down 10.49% to 5.89, time-on-site is down 19% to 5:03, and bounce rate is up 19% to 32.60.|Wal-Mart, on the other hand, delivered diluted EPS of $4.52 in FY 2012 and $5.02 in FY 2013. Therefore, Wal-Mart is likely to remain the most reliable of the three when it comes to returning capital to shareholders. Wal-Mart currently yields 2.50%, whereas Best Buy yields 1.60%. Amazon doesn't offer any yield.|With Amazon stronger on the top line and Wal-Mart stronger on the bottom line, it seems illogical to opt for Best Buy as an investment. One argument in Best Buy's favor is that it offers a more attractive valuation of 16 times forward earnings versus 129 times forward earnings for Amazon. Wal-Mart is trading at 13 times forward earnings.|The bearish argument is that Wal-Mart can easily build out to offer similar products at similar prices (with more marketing power) while Best Buy doesn't stand a chance of competing with Amazon online.|Best Buy has proven naysayers (like myself) wrong so far this year, with the stock appreciating 267% year to date. I don't own positions in any of these stocks, but if I wanted growth, I would go with Amazon. If I wanted safe dividend payments, I would go with Wal-Mart.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/credit-cards-sure-are-getting-expensive.aspx|10/29/2013|1|"American Express"|0|In the payment processing space, two names tower over any competition: MasterCard and Visa (NYSE: V) . These companies are different from the other major credit card brands like American Express (NYSE: AXP) in that they merely provide payment processing and support services -- they don't actually issue the credit cards that bear their brands.|An alternative: similar but differentAmerican Express is a viable alternative that is looking more attractively valued at current levels, but is still expensive on a historical basis. Unlike the other two companies, American Express issues its own cards and has a leading position in global travel services.|The company's name is practically synonymous with the concept of a traveler's check, and it has done an excellent job of improving its international revenue stream over the past few years. More than half of American Express' revenue comes from U.S. card spending (interest and fees), a revenue stream that neither Visa nor MasterCard has (at least not directly).|Additionally, American Express is the cheapest company on a valuation basis, by far. It is expected to report earnings of $4.91 per share this year, meaning it trades for 16.8 times current year earnings, much better than the other two. While annual earnings growth is expected to be somewhat less (around 12% annually for the next three years), its valuation is more justified.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/communicating-in-the-enterprise.aspx|10/29/2013|1|"AT&T"|2|Transitioning from traditionCompanies are looking toward UC to improve response times, increase employee productivity, and reduce operational costs, according to Infonetics. The standard enterprise setup, which includes things like the traditional telephone, is disappearing, and telecommunications firms like AT&T (NYSE: T) know it.|In March, AT&T announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to expand its UC portfolio. The company will be integrating its global IP network with Microsoft Lync, which will allow customers to utilize real-time collaboration on documents, participate in high-definition video conferences and virtual meetings, and provide a "full range of enterprise voice capabilities." Lync will also allow AT&T business customers to "use instant messaging presence to quickly find and communicate with colleagues," according to a press release.|The deal is important for AT&T because it not only bolsters its overall UC portfolio, but also gives it credibility by partnering with a leader. According to Microsoft, "60% of enterprises (500+ seats) surveyed are deploying or planning to deploy Lync, including enterprise voice, up from 45% last year." AT&T now has very lucrative exposure to the rapidly growing Microsoft Lync, as well as further diversification in its business-centered offerings.|The bottom lineUnified communications, especially cloud-based voice and video, will continue to be adopted by enterprises going forward, providing growth for Microsoft and Cisco. The two companies are the most dominant forces in UC, and will continue to dig their moats deeper. Telecoms like AT&T will also receive growth from this trend as more cloud-based services are utilized and more data is used.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/should-att-be-part-of-your-portfolio.aspx|10/29/2013|1|"AT&T"|0|Should AT&T Be Part of Your Portfolio?|The wireless industry is taking an interesting turn with rising threat from smaller national carriers Sprint and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) . While Sprint is intensely involved in building its Network Vision, T-Mobile is aggressively working on marketing campaigns targeting budget-bound customers to shift from rival networks, particularly AT&T (NYSE: T) . However, the Dallas carrier's third-quarter results for the fiscal year stayed strong as its subscriber base showed decent growth and its data plans generated good revenue.|Quarter in a snapshotAT&T's consolidated revenue increased 2.2% to $32.2 billion compared to the same quarter last year. Wireless revenue went up 5.1% to $17.5 billion, while operating income increased 3.4% to $4.6 billion. Increasing data usage from heavy Internet users led the carrier to report a 17.6% rise in wireless data revenue. The continued shift to smartphones, tablets, and similar devices has increased the consumption of data, driving wireless revenue growth.|AT&T's operating income marginally increased to $6.2 billion from $6 billion in the third quarter of 2013. The net income attributable to AT&T was $3.8 billion over last year's $3.6 billion. The mobile operator posted a solid quarter, though there were concerns regarding increased competition from T-Mobile, thanks to new smartphone connections and higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, which notably bolstered wireless revenue.|Subscriber additions -- the saviorThe second-largest national carrier is currently focusing on subscriber addition and boosting ARPU. AT&T recorded a total increase of nearly 989,000 wireless subscribers during the quarter. Of the total, 363,000 connections were postpaid customers, more than twice the additions that the company made last year. This is good news for the carrier, as postpaid connections are most profitable.|In addition, of the total postpaid connections, 178,000 were smartphone users who are increasingly becoming heavy Internet consumers. This is precisely why AT&T's ARPU for smartphone subscribers is more than twice the ARPU of its non-smartphone customer base. This automatically boosted the ARPU for postpaid handsets, which rose 3.1%. Also, AT&T experienced record sales of 6.7 million smartphones, which accounted for 89% of postpaid sales for the quarter. The expansion of the smartphone base is essential to driving ARPU growth, and in turn, wireless revenue in the face of rising competition.|Unfortunately, the situation doesn't look so promising for AT&T anymore. Increasing subscriber base is a necessity for any carrier to grow, but if AT&T charges more to enjoy higher ARPU, it may lose a good number of subscribers to Sprint and T-Mobile, in particular, which is very candid about offering lower plan prices to lure customers away from AT&T's network.|Growing threatPreviously, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) was the only carrier effectively competing with AT&T. But, now both of the smaller national players are putting in huge effort to give solid competition to the virtual duopoly.|T-Mobile, on the other hand, is increasingly posing a threat to the telecom giants, AT&T in particular. The fourth-largest national player is offering simplified, cheaper plans to win subscribers from bigger rivals. The carrier recorded the addition of 685,000 contract subscribers in the last quarter. Also, T-Mobile is pretty vocal about targeting AT&T's customer base. Just before AT&T released its earnings, T-Mobile announced its free monthly data offer of 200MB for iPad users.|Foolish bottom lineAT&T's third quarter has been impressive. Competition is heating up, but AT&T is also planning its moves accordingly. The carrier made a huge capital investment of $6 billion in the third quarter for network upgrading to keep its edge over Sprint and T-Mobile. Currently, Verizon leads as far as LTE network coverage, which has helped the telecom player maintain its supremacy over fellow rivals. AT&T's LTE network covers around 250 million Americans. The wireless provider is expected to spend heavily on network upgrades over the next couple of years. Obviously, such huge investments would build pressure on the company's profitability margins, but they are unavoidable if the carrier wants to stay competitive.|AT&T is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.89 and is expected to grow in the future. As per its projected earnings for the next fiscal year, the stock is trading just 13.18 times its earnings. In fact, AT&T is the most attractive stock compared to its peers. Verizon has a forward P/E of 14.41, while T-Mobile is has a forward P/E 32.05.|Additionally, AT&T has made huge investments to differentiate its network, providing quality and high speed Internet service. In fact, the carrier's network speed beats Big Red's speed as found in recent tests. AT&T has an encouraging future outlook and I strongly believe that this cheap telecom stock could add spark to your portfolio.

That may not sound like a lot, but that's in addition to the already promised 13% fuel improvement to customers.|"This recent fuel-efficiency gain will widen the performance gap in the single-aisle market, reinforcing the 737 MAX's position as the value leader," Keith Leverkuhn, vice president and general manager for the 737 MAX program, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a press release.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/29/can-boeing-and-its-suppliers-succeed-by-teaming-up.aspx|10/29/2013|1|"Boeing"|0|Can Boeing and Its Suppliers Succeed by Teaming Up?|Boeing (NYSE: BA) has launched a new program to help its suppliers -- in return for a little favor from them. The aerospace giant's offering to work closely with the companies that supply parts for its military and commercial aircraft, helping them redesign their supply chains and improve their productivity. But in exchange, those suppliers will have to charge Boeing less when they renew their contracts. Let's see how this program might affect two of Boeing's most prominent suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR) and TransDigm (NYSE: TDG).|Everything is relativeOne easy way of assessing the impact of Boeing's "Partnering for Success" program on a supplier is to find out how much of its revenues come from Boeing. Boeing accounted for 84% and 13% of the fiscal 2012 sales for Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm, respectively. However, it would be misleading to simply conclude that Spirit AeroSystems will suffer more from Boeing's new initiatives than TransDigm. There are other factors at play here.|About three-quarters of TransDigm's revenues are generated from products, for which it is the sole supplier to its customers. In Spirit AeroSystems' case, it is the only supplier for almost all of the products it supplies to Boeing. Moreover, Spirit AeroSystems' supply agreements with Boeing are typically long-term, lasting for the full length of the aircraft programs. As a result, both TransDigm and Spirit AeroSystems have sufficient bargaining power to resist any unreasonable price reductions, since Boeing may have trouble finding alternative suppliers.|It's tough to switchBuilding aircraft isn't child's play; there are thousands of lives at stake with each flight. Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing take a long time to carry out testing and certification for new suppliers, to ensure that the high quality and safety standards are upheld.|Assuming that Boeing is willing to go through this laborious process of qualifying new suppliers, potential rival suppliers still may not be willing to enter certain product segments which incumbents like Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm already dominate. The huge capital investment required is a natural barrier to entry.|There are also other factors specific to the two suppliers that make it so difficult for Boeing to turn to alternative suppliers.|TransDigm's niche aerospace parts tend to make up a relatively small part of the total cost of a plane, which suggest that Boeing should look elsewhere to really bring down its costs. In general, customers are more price-sensitive when a particular product makes up a big proportion of their budgets. It looks like Boeing has indeed given TransDigm greater leeway in its pricing, allowing it to deliver consistent gross margins exceeding 50% since its IPO in 2006.|Business isn't just about hard numbers, either; relationships play a big part in deciding who gets what. Spirit AeroSystems was started in 2005, after Canadian private equity firm Onex purchased what was once Boeing's "in-house" manufacturing facilities for fuselage, propulsion and wing systems. Many members of Spirit AeroSystems' management team are former Boeing employees. Current CEO Jeffrey Turner used to be General Manager of the Boeing Wichita Division, and worked there for more than three decades. It will be almost impossible for another supplier to build such deep relationships with Boeing.|The view from BoeingBoeing managed to expand its operating margins for the Commercial Airplanes segment by 210 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, which could be attributed to higher delivery volume and productivity gains. In a response to an analyst query about the "Partnering for Success" program at the results conference call, CEO James McNerney said that tactics such as sourcing in-house or switching suppliers will be less important if suppliers believe in what Boeing's objective of driving the highest margins for both itself and its suppliers. But he did add that "those tactics are available to us."|I don't doubt that many suppliers could potentially improve their cost structure by working with Boeing. However, it never hurts to have a few extra bargaining chips when come to the negotiating table with this aerospace giant.|ConclusionI'm not claiming that Boeing's "Partnering for Success" program won't affect suppliers at all. There's no denying that Boeing's scale gives it tremendous bargaining power. However, each supplier will be affected to a different extent, depending on a variety of factors which I have touched on above.|In my opinion, Spirit AeroSystems and TransDigm are less likely to be affected. It's too expensive for Boeing to switch to other suppliers, and too difficult for those potential suppliers to enter the market in the first place.

AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File|For decades, the Boeing 747 was the Queen of the Skies. But the glamorous double-decker jumbo jet that revolutionized air travel and shrunk the globe could be nearing the end of the line.|Boeing has cut its production target twice in six months. Just 18 will be produced in each of the next two years. Some brand-new 747s go into storage as soon as they leave the plant. Counting cancellations, it hadn't sold a single 747 this year until Korean Air bought five last week.|Boeing says it's committed to the 747, and sees a market for it in regions like Asia. But most airlines simply don't want big, four-engine planes anymore. They prefer newer two-engine jets that fly the same distance while burning less fuel.|International travel was mostly limited to those who could afford the pricy flights. The 747 changed that. The first 747s could seat twice as many passengers as the preferred international jet of the time, the Boeing 707. Long flights became more economical for the airlines. Ticket prices fell and soon a summer vacation in Europe was no longer just for the wealthy.|Boeing began building 747s in the late 1960s. Production peaked at 122 in 1990. Overall, Boeing sold a total of 1,418 747s before redesigning the plane in 2011. The 747's success helped put Boeing ahead of U.S. competitors Lockheed, which left the passenger jet business in 1983, and McDonnell Douglas, which Boeing acquired in 1997.|As engines became more powerful and reliable, the government in 1988 started allowing certain planes with just two engines to fly over the ocean, as far as three hours away from the nearest airport. Within a decade, twin-engine planes like the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 777 began to dominate long-haul routes.|The cost is a factor. The 747 is Boeing's most expensive plane with a list price of around $350 million, compared with $320 million for Boeing's biggest 777.|Air Force One is the world's most visible airplane. The two modified Boeing 747-200s that do the job now will be 30 years old in 2017. The Air Force is seeking a four-engine replacement, making the Pentagon one of the last airplane shoppers eager to buy fuel for four engines instead of two. Boeing and Airbus are the only Western jetmakers with such a plane.|Boeing has said it wants the job and has responded to a U.S. Air Force request for information. Airbus has not. The European company was widely assumed to be at a disadvantage against an American planemaker.|Impact on BoeingBoeing says that slowing 747 production won't have a significant financial impact.|Boeing's stock hit an all-time high of $129.99 last week. It has gained 74% so far this year, more than four times the gain in the Dow Jones industrial average.|Boeing has a backlog of some 4,787 planes, most of that orders for the best-selling 737. It has sped up production of the 737, as well as the 777, and plans to boost its output of 787s in 2016. Boeing gets the bulk of the money from a new plane upon delivery, so faster deliveries mean better cash flow.|Boeing is expected to begin offering customers a new version of the 777 by year's end. With about 400 seats, that plane is widely expected to kill off demand for the 747 from passenger airlines, although the freighter version may survive longer.|Boeing isn't giving up on its iconic airplane, and has sold more than 100 of the new version, including freighters. Marketing chief Randy Tinseth says the economic downturn of the past five years has hurt 747 sales.

http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2013/10/29/why-boeings-dividend-should-soar-higher-soon.aspx|10/29/2013|1|"Boeing"|4|Why Boeing's Dividend Should Soar Higher Soon|Boeing (NYSE: BA) has enjoyed a huge run of success, with its stock soaring to new all-time highs as demand for commercial aircraft has led to unprecedented numbers of orders for the industry. Yet unlike fellow defense-industry players Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) , Boeing's dividend yield lags behind the market average. With solid growth in its earnings projected for the foreseeable future, when will Boeing share its wealth with shareholders?|Boeing has a history of being conservative with its dividend, keeping it flat during long stretches during the 1990s and early 2000s. The aerospace giant started lifting its payout regularly over the past decade, but the financial crisis led it to hold its dividends steady until the worst of the recession had ended. Now, Boeing appears ready to start a new streak of dividend growth. Let's take a closer look at Boeing to see whether it's likely to keep its young streak going and raise its payout again in early 2014.|Dividend Stats on Boeing|How high can Boeing dividends fly? Boeing shareholders can't seriously complain about a subpar dividend yield, largely because that yield's decline has come from a huge run-up in its share price. Over the past year, Boeing's stock is up almost 90%, and that increase in share price by itself has played a major role in reducing Boeing's dividend yield from the roughly 2.5% level it enjoyed this time last year. Defense peers Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have also enjoyed substantial share price gains, but their returns in the 50% range reflect the fact that they've benefited far less from the civilian side of the business than Boeing has.|Much of Boeing's success has come from the newly found financial health of airlines around the world. Domestically, big players in the airline industry have ridden ancillary fees on baggage and other items to big gains in profits, and they've been anxious to put their cash to work by modernizing their aging fleets and replacing costly older aircraft with newer, more fuel-efficient models that can reduce their overall costs. Boeing has done its best to jump on the gold rush in capital expenditures, although rival Airbus has also captured its fair share of orders from the world's airlines.|Boeing continues to make headlines for the wrong reasons, though. Its 787 Dreamliner has kept having numerous technical problems, although recent setbacks have paled in comparison to the battery problems that grounded the aircraft entirely for several months earlier this year. Airlines have been willing to give Boeing the benefit of the doubt, but as problems persist, more prospective buyers could follow the lead of Japan Airlines and give large orders to Airbus in order to express their dissatisfaction.|Still, Boeing hasn't put all its bets on the commercial aerospace industry. The company teamed up with Lockheed Martin on a bid for the next-generation stealth bomber that could bring in $55 billion. Continued budget pressure could make such opportunities few and far between, raising the stakes for Boeing to make sure it capitalizes on them when they arise.|Boeing's 10% dividend increase last year marked an acceleration in the company's dividend growth from its early 2012 increase, and with earnings estimates continuing to rise sharply, Boeing has more room to make further increases without causing cash-flow problems. With the aerospace giant paying just a third of its earnings to shareholders as dividends -- a lower level than either Lockheed Martin or Raytheon -- even a sizable increase wouldn't raise its payout ratio to unacceptable levels.|When will Boeing boost its payout?Just yesterday, Boeing declared its regular fourth-quarter dividend, keeping it at $0.485 per share. That payout will mark its fourth-straight quarter at that level, raising the possibility that Boeing could send its dividend higher early next year.|Another 10% increase to roughly $0.535 per share would still leave Boeing with a payout ratio less than 40%. It would also leave its yield at relatively low levels, but Boeing would need a much higher increase to $0.65 per share just to reach the 2% yield mark at current share prices.|Given Boeing's conservative nature, investors should expect only a more modest increase in its dividend. In the long run, though, continued profit growth could help Boeing start a long streak of dividend growth for long-term investors.|Are Boeing's dividends your best bet?Income investors know that dividend stocks can make you rich.

ExxonMobil's production was down slightly in its second quarter and I wouldn't expect a big production jump for the third quarter.|BP may have surprised investors on the upside today, and Chevron and ExxonMobil may do so later this week, but keep an eye on the trends for all three companies. Oil production is flat to declining, and high oil prices are squeezing refining margins. That points to lower earnings, something I don't see turning around anytime soon.

The two largest U.S. based integrated oil majors are ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) , so let's first take a look at what an investment in these will cost you.|Chevron is a similar case, trading for an even cheaper 10.2 times this year's earnings. It is cheaper for a reason, however, with analysts estimating between $10.83 and $15.05 per share for next year (2014). If the numbers come in on the high end, it could be a steal at the current share price, but that is a big "if" at this point.|The two companies are pretty similar investments. Chevron pays a slightly higher yield (3.3% vs. 2.9%), and both companies have excellent records of raising their payouts every year. Both are in excellent financial shape, with more cash on their balance sheets than debt, especially in Chevron's case, where there is $10 billion more cash than long-term debt.

Duke told Eric Krapf of No Jitter that, while competitors are seeing flat or negative sales, Microsoft is seeing 60% growth on an annual basis. He also noted that the company is well on its way to surpassing Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) , the current leader in overall collaboration sales, "very soon."|Cisco is the leader, and wants it to stay that wayWhen Kevin Turner announced Microsoft's lead in enterprise voice, he did so at Cisco's Collaboration Summit. The company is looking to continue to extend its lead, after announcing its new Intelligent Proximity technology.|The technology will allow users to link their personal mobile devices with on-premises products in the office, and will be first implemented in Cisco's Android-based DX650 Smart Desk Phone in November. Users will be able to sync Android or Apple smartphones to their desk phones, and will also be able to move a call already in progress from their mobile devices to the DX650. Contacts and call histories will also be able to be imported to the DX650.|Cisco is blurring the lines between personal and office devices by seamlessly syncing them together. This will further build on its current leadership position in enterprise collaboration, which already includes real-time collaboration, secure voice, instant messaging, and video communications. The company also utilizes Transport Layer Security, which is the same technology used to secure e-commerce transactions.|The bottom lineUnified communications, especially cloud-based voice and video, will continue to be adopted by enterprises going forward, providing growth for Microsoft and Cisco. The two companies are the most dominant forces in UC, and will continue to dig their moats deeper. Telecoms like AT&T will also receive growth from this trend as more cloud-based services are utilized and more data is used.|Cisco and Microsoft currently trade around 12 and 13 times earnings, respectively. Both companies are financially strong, carrying large cash balances that dwarf the amount of debt carried. Both companies offer value at current levels, especially for those looking to invest in the enterprise leaders of tomorrow.

The company lost its status as a Dividend Aristocrat by failing to raise its dividend for the first time since 1975 and made a painful dividend cut of nearly 70% in 2009. But General Electric has bounced back recently, and despite having already raised its dividend five times over the past three years, attentive investors are looking for the company to deliver another increase that should keep its yield comfortably ahead of fellow conglomerates 3M (NYSE: MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) .|General Electric has undergone a huge transformation in recent years, returning to its industrial roots with a particular emphasis on energy. That has produced big successes for GE, as the booming oil and gas industry and the rise of renewables like wind and solar have positioned the conglomerate well to take advantage of exciting growth prospects in the sector. In addition, a big boost in aerospace activity has helped the company's aviation segment produce strong growth as well. But investors have to remember the rapidity with which General Electric's past success came to a screeching halt during the financial crisis. Let's take a closer look at General Electric to see whether it's likely to raise its dividend before the year is out.|Dividend Stats on General Electric|Will General Electric make it four straight? General Electric's recovery has gone well beyond its dividend, as its stock has also bounced back sharply since early 2009. The company has kept its share price moving sharply higher, with gains of 27% over the past year. Yet those returns haven't kept General Electric up with United Technologies or 3M, both of which have posted one-year returns in the 40% range.|One area in which General Electric and United Technologies have both thrived is in aerospace. GE has an extensive aircraft-engine business, matching up well against United Tech's Pratt & Whitney division and getting its share of orders on both the military and commercial side of the aerospace industry. Given the huge rise in demand for aircraft as airlines seek to modernize their fleets and gain from new opportunities for fuel efficiency and cost reduction, both General Electric and United Technologies should see continued growth in the segment.|Yet General Electric's bigger focus has been on energy, where it has done a better job than 3M in capturing the full breadth of the opportunities for profit. From its longtime strength in wind energy and electrical infrastructure to newer forays into the oil and gas services industry and liquefied natural gas processing niche, General Electric has made big bets on the ability of the energy boom to last for years. In particular, exposure to the growing undersea energy area could bring huge rewards for General Electric, as high oil prices make even ultra-deepwater projects economically viable and open up huge potential resources for development in the decades to come.|General Electric has also been smart about looking toward its future. Smart investments in budding areas like 3-D printing and its concept of the "Industrial Internet" could drive future profits and give it important early mover status in key technologies. Such moves are essential to keep innovative competitors like 3M and United Technologies at bay.|General Electric has been fairly quick in getting its dividend back up toward pre-crisis levels, with boosts of 12% to 13% over the past two years adding up to a near-doubling of its distribution since mid-2010. Profit growth has helped support these increases, but GE will need to keep working hard to keep earnings growing if it wants to keep its dividends rising at a double-digit percentage pace. By contrast, both United Technologies and 3M have been more conservative in keeping their payout ratios lower than General Electric.|When will General Electric boost its payout?Last month, General Electric said it would keep its dividend unchanged for the quarter, with its $0.19 quarterly payout arriving in shareholders' accounts last week. That marked the fourth-straight quarter for the dividend at its current level, making it likely that General Electric will send its dividend higher during the fourth quarter.|It would be natural for General Electric to maintain its $0.02 per share pace in its increases, making a December quarterly payment of $0.21 per share seem reasonable. That would push the yield back above the 3% mark and leave it well ahead of 3M and United Technologies. That might not get the dividend back to its 2008 high as soon as some shareholders would like, but it marks a smart balance for General Electric between healthy dividend income and future growth prospects.|Why General Electric has made investors so happyGeneral Electric's recent gains just prove how dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. Over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $0.92 per share, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $0.88. However, revenue declined 4% to $11.03 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $11.12 billion.|All four of Merck's business segments posted year-over-year declines. Its animal health segment was dragged down by a cattle feed recall, and its consumer segment was hurt by weak demand for Dr. Scholl's footcare products.|Source: Merck's third-quarter earnings report.|However, Merck's pharmaceutical segment, which accounts for the lion's share of its top line, remains the top concern for investors.|In that crucial segment, Merck's main problem continues to be the loss of patent exclusivity for its top-selling asthma medication, Singulair, which generated $3.3 billion in annual sales last year. Moreover, a delay of its osteoporosis drug -- along with the rejections of its insomnia and anesthesia drugs -- exacerbated concerns that Merck was about to plunge off a patent cliff without a parachute to slow its fall.|Analyzing Merck's pharmaceutical strengthsFive of Merck's treatments and a group of vaccines, which together accounted for 34% of the pharmaceutical segment's sales, reported positive sales growth in the third quarter.|Merck also reported strong growth with Gardasil, one of the two most widely used HPV vaccines in the world -- the other one being GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE: GSK) Cervarix.

The fading drug faces an onslaught of generic competitors, which include Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Mylan, and Teva Pharmaceutical.|The increasingly crowded diabetes marketTo offset Singulair' losses, Merck has been counting on its two top diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, to pick up the slack. However, this strategy could face three major problems -- uneven sales, rising competition, and peaking sales. Janumet is a combination drug that combines Januvia with metformin, which controls blood sugar levels.|Therefore, rising competition and peaking sales figures are now casting serious doubt on the idea that Merck's diabetes franchise will solve its Singulair woes.|Perlmutter has emphasized the importance of Merck's oncology pipeline, specifically MK-3475, a potential skin cancer treatment that could compete against Roche's Zelboraf and Bristol-Myers' Yervoy. Another oncology treatment to keep an eye on is MK-1775, a new ovarian cancer drug that it is co-developing with AstraZeneca.|During the quarter, Merck received a breakthrough designation for its combination treatment for hepatitis C. Merck also completed a phase 3 trial of a new HPV vaccine, which is now on track for a new drug application.|Another project to keep an eye on is Merck's collaboration with Pfizer to bring a new SGLT2 inhibitor to the market to compete with Johnson & Johnson's Invokana and Forxiga, co-developed by Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca. SGLT2 inhibitors are a lucrative new class of diabetes treatments, which help patients excrete excess blood sugar through their urine.|The Foolish takeawayIn closing, slumping Singulair sales are still weighing on Merck's top line, sales of its diabetes drugs are slowing down, and its upcoming products are still too far away to make a difference.

But the real poison pill was that Merck execs narrowed EPS forecasts for full-year 2013 from a range of $3.45 to $3.55 to between $3.48 and $3.52. Investors basically told America's second-largest drugmaker to go home and chug some chicken noodle soup, sending the stock down 2.56% on Monday (we suggest shareholders take some Advil).|Merck's diagnosis? It's bleeding jobs. Earlier this month, Merck revealed that it's firing 8,500 of its 80,000 workers -- on top of the 7,500 job cuts it had already announced this fall. Like other drugmakers, Merck is also selling off its nonpharmaceutical businesses and giving its research and development department an injection to refocus on developing new medicines that drive revenue.|The two big problems for Merck last quarter were animals and diabetes. Merck's animal health brands suffered a 2% sales drop last quarter after the company stopped marketing its cattle weight-gain supplement Zilmax, which was making cows tired (just give your cattle some protein shakes if you want them to pack on the pounds). And sales of type-2 diabetes oral wonder-drug Januvia fell 5% from the prior-year quarter as competition from Bristol-Myers began to take up some more market share.

The team has this to say about their recommendation:|"We rate Microsoft Corp (MSFT) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, attractive valuation levels and increase in stock price during the past year. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow."|The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Software industry and the overall market, Microsoft Corp's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.

For example, like the other two big insurers, Aetna reported a jump in revenue. In Aetna's case, the 46% year-over-year increase to $12.99 billion came largely from the company's acquisition of Coventry.|Also like UnitedHealth and WellPoint, though, Aetna's profit from core insurance products didn't fare as well. Aetna's net income did grow by 4% year over year to $518.6 million as operating earnings increased 7%. But the company noted that essentially all of the operating earnings growth stemmed from the buyout of Coventry. On a per-share basis, both net income and operating income fell compared to the third quarter of last year because of dilution of shares.|One of the biggest drags on earnings came from Medicare. Aetna's Medicare medical benefits ratio, a measure of an insurer's health-care costs as a percentage of premiums received, soared from 82.5% in the third quarter last year to 87.8% this year. Part of the issue was due to a really good experience in 2012, but federal Medicare cuts were cited as a significant issue along with a couple of underperforming Medicare products. UnitedHealth also specifically mentioned that increased Medicare costs negatively affected earnings.|Aetna's approach with individual insurance plans on the Obamacare exchanges matches that of UnitedHealth more closely than it does WellPoint. Both Aetna and UnitedHealth have taken relatively cautious stances -- declining to participate in every state exchange where the companies operate.

I have no positions, but after researching one company after the next in consumer goods, it has become clearly evident that high-discount retailers are outperforming traditional retailers by wide margins, regardless of what's being sold. SUPERVALU is aware of the trend and it plans on expanding the Save-A-Lot footprint. However, it's going to run into a lot of competition from dollar stores, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) , Kroger (NYSE: KR) , and others, so there are no guarantees.|SUPERVALU vs. Wal-Mart and KrogerSUPERVALU has a market cap of $1.91 billion, which makes it much smaller than Wal-Mart (market cap of $247.14 billion) and Kroger (market cap of $22.35 billion). Therefore, SUPERVALU doesn't have nearly as much marketing power as its competition. And while the dollar stores might not be as big as Wal-Mart or Kroger, they don't need as much marketing power. They attracted millions of consumers during The Great Recession who now remain loyal to them. SUPERVALU, on the other hand, isn't offering a new and unique concept that will attract and retain new customers.|SUPERVALU also isn't very good at turning revenue into profit. It sports a net margin of negative 7.43%, whereas Kroger is in positive territory at 1.60% and Wal-Mart is stronger at 3.61%. Furthermore, SUPERVALU doesn't offer any yield. This is understandably so, but the facts are the facts, and they're all that matter. Kroger yields 1.60%, and Wal-Mart is once again more impressive, yielding 2.50%.|Additionally, Wal-Mart is launching its small-box stores early next year. While the purpose of this is to steal market share from the dollar stores (or attempt to annihilate them), this may also have a negative impact on SUPERVALU. If you happen to be interested in an investment in Wal-Mart, you should also know that it plans on opening 110 new stores in China over the next three years while closing 20 to 25 underperforming Chinese locations by the end of the first quarter of next year. This is being done to increase profitability.|While Wal-Mart might be the most impressive company of the three on a fundamental basis, Kroger has high expectations for the future, which include full-year comps growth of 3% to 3.5% (from 2.5% to 3.5%). Kroger has delivered 39 consecutive quarters of comps growth.|The bottom lineIf you're going to invest in grocery stores (or big-box stores now highly focused on groceries), it makes little sense to gamble on SUPERVALU when Kroger and Wal-Mart are available options. Wal-Mart's growth might not be rampant, but it's still growing and that 2.50% yield is enticing. Kroger might only yield 1.60%, but its Harris Teeter acquisition gives it strong growth potential and its consistent comps growth indicates that shoppers are highly satisfied.|Wal-Mart makes the list below, but there are eight others Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notoriety of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn. And over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine.

(For the record, it currently yields 2.50%.) While Wal-Mart is one of the safest dividend plays you will find in the market, its top-line growth potential isn't excitingly high. The company can grow its top line via international expansion into emerging markets, its small-box stores launching next year, its food offerings, and its Sam's Club brand. However, as stated above, it's a mature company.|Then there's Costco (NASDAQ: COST) , a company that's growing a little faster on the top line because consumers are interested in high-quality products at discounted prices. Costco yields 1.10%, which is not as much as Wal-Mart, but its faster top-line growth makes up for that. Costco is a very impressive company in nearly every facet.|Imagine a similar company that's growing even faster than Costco, primarily thanks to its locations in high-growth markets.

Its warehouses are located in high-traffic areas in cities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. With only 31 warehouses, there is a lot of room for growth. The one potential negative is its valuation. If any surprise negative news comes out, the stock could drop quickly. However, savvy investors know not to pay attention to short-term moves in stock prices. If anything, these drops provide opportunities to add to positions in strong underlying companies. All that said, Costco and Wal-Mart are likely to be safer long-term investments thanks to their size, brand strength, and marketing power. It all comes down to your risk tolerance.

The company's quarterly loss was 70% worse than investors had expected, and the company managed to lose more than 1 million contract customers during the quarter. Yet shares rose on the news, with the implication that the results could have been worse. Improving average revenue per user was indeed good news, and AT&T and Verizon both suffered from the realization that Sprint wouldn't disappear anytime soon.|Now, though, it's up to Sprint and Softbank to execute on their plans. Softbank has started with its capital injections in order to allow Sprint to make strategic acquisitions like the purchase of Clearwire. In the long run, though, Softbank hopes to use combined economies of scale to negotiate better deals with smartphone and mobile-device makers, boosting profits or giving Sprint more room to compete on price against Verizon and AT&T.|One contentious area involving the major U.S. carriers has been in coming out with early upgrade plans. AT&T and Verizon followedT-Mobile in giving customers the right to upgrade their devices early in exchange for monthly device payments on existing plans in addition to regular voice and data subscription costs. Last month, Sprint followed with its One Up program, offering the choice of paying for their phones in 24 equal installments, with the right to upgrade after a year. Sprint also offered a $15 monthly discount on several of its service plans to offset the unsubsidized costs of the phones. As a way of weaning Americans off costly subsidies, the plans are a good first step for Sprint and its rivals.

Meanwhile, Boeing was also able to lift its full-year guidance for core EPS from a $6.20-$6.40 range to a $6.50-$6.55 range. This good news sent the stock soaring to a new all-time high.|The biggest factor in Boeing's earnings beat was something that could best be described as an accounting trick. The company increased the accounting block for the 787 Dreamliner, a maneuver that boosted Boeing's operating margin -- as I will explain in more detail. Yet even without this accounting trick, Boeing had plenty of good news to report.|Program accountingAs my colleague Daniel Ferry explains, Boeing uses an accounting technique called "program accounting" to measure costs for each airplane family. When Boeing introduces a new model, it sells it for significantly less than the initial production cost. However, production costs tend to drop fairly dramatically over time as Boeing and suppliers learn how to build the planes more efficiently. Increases in the production rate also help reduce Boeing's costs.|Program accounting smooths out these typical changes in profitability over time. Rather than reporting losses on the first few hundred aircraft it sells and big profits on subsequent deliveries, Boeing estimates the total profit it will earn over the life of the program and then assigns a portion of that profit to each plane it sells. These estimates depend heavily on how many airplanes Boeing plans to sell.|A new accounting blockDuring Q3, Boeing increased the accounting block for the 787 Dreamliner from 1,100 to 1,300, due in part to the launch of the larger 787-10 version back in June. In other words, Boeing now assumes that it will sell 1,300 Dreamliners over the life of the program.|In June, Boeing began selling a larger Dreamliner variant, the 787-10 (Photo: Boeing)|By adding 200 planes to the end of the production block (when the 787 will be at its most profitable), Boeing increased its expectations for the program's total profit. While development of the 787-10 also increased Boeing's costs, the net result was still an increase in the program's profit margin. Under the rules of program accounting, some of that extra profit gets assigned to the 787s Boeing is currently delivering, allowing Boeing to report a higher profit margin.|Trick or treat?Thus, while Boeing did post a good performance last quarter, the main reason it beat analysts' expectations was the addition of 200 planes to the Boeing 787 accounting block. Investors don't need to panic, though, because the 787 sales goal is still quite conservative!|Indeed, Boeing has already secured orders for 979 Dreamliners, of which it had delivered just 89 at the end of last month. Boeing has taken 131 net new orders for the 787 in 2013, many of which represent orders for the stretched 787-10.|The 787-10 is comparable in size to Boeing's 777-200, which was first delivered in 1995. Early 777s will be ripe for retirement within the next 10 years or so. As operators think about how to replace those planes, a flood of new 787-10 orders should come in. In fact, Boeing has estimated the total market for aircraft in the 787's size range at 3,300 aircraft from 2011-2030, and expects to reap more than half of those sales.|In other words, the long-term market for the Dreamliner is far bigger than even the revised 1,300 unit accounting quantity. As Boeing works through its backlog -- which already fills almost all of its production capacity through the end of the decade -- and takes new orders, it will eventually be able to lift its accounting quantity yet again. This will provide another big boost to Boeing's profit margin sometime down the road.|Smooth sailingSo far, it looks like Boeing has not been damaged by the Dreamliner's reliability issues. Customers are continuing to order the Dreamliner in large numbers, particularly due to the launch of the larger 787-10. Meanwhile, the re-engined 737 MAX has also been a big seller, helping Boeing boost its order backlog to a record $415 billion.|With Boeing expected to launch yet another redesigned airplane -- the 777X -- later this year, the company's sales momentum should continue. Many customers have expressed interest in the 777X, which will be an ideal replacement for the large number of older, fuel-guzzling 747s still in use.|Boeing's higher earnings and guidance may have been the result of an accounting trick. However, that doesn't mean that Boeing is overstating its earnings. In fact, Boeing is still underestimating the Dreamliner's potential for accounting purposes. As Boeing's order backlog continues to grow, investors can expect plenty of additional revenue and margin growth.|Great stocks for global growthWith the American markets reaching new highs, investors and pundits alike are skeptical about future growth.

Doing some simple math you get a cost of $19.80 per barrel, excluding future maintenance costs and operational costs.|This just so happens to be Canada's largest refiner, so even though Canada's heavy crude trades around $60-$75 ExxonMobil and Chevron will be able to get better prices due to the close proximity. Prices are low due to lack of pipeline infrastructure, but as more capacity is built up expect the spread between WTI and Canadian heavy crude to shrink.|The projectThe Hebron project has 1.2 million barrels of storage capacity built into it and is going to start producing 150,000 bpd in 2017. At $70 a barrel ExxonMobil and Chevron will be able to cover the cost of construction within 1,867 days, or five years and one month.|Going beyond the cost of production, the current amount of reserves allows for ~13 years of production at 150,000 bpd. There is a good chance that the amount of reserves could be revised upwards, as it already has been revised upwards from previous estimates. Hebron will offer ExxonMobil and Chevron stable cash flow for years if they follow through with their plans.|Final thoughtsThe Arctic holds trillions of dollars' worth of energy, and those who are able to successfully get it out of the ground will reap huge returns. ExxonMobil and Chevron's move into the Arctic through the Hebron project will offer years of cash flow, with the potential for growth from finding more recoverable oil and from higher oil prices.

Hewlett-Packard, for example, reported in its fiscal third quarter results that enterprise service revenue declined approximately 2.6% from the previous quarter. However, the division's earnings (before interest) and tax margin expanded to 3.3%, up from 2.6%. Furthermore, Hewlett-Packard reported expanding profit margins within its software division. In particular, software revenue fell 1% year over year, but the division's pre-tax profit margin expanded by 2% to 20% during the fiscal third quarter.|Cisco also reported rising demand for its services. When the company reported its fiscal full-year 2013 results in August, it was revealed that overall revenue expanded 5.5% YoY, led by revenue from services, which grew 8.7%. This uptick in service revenue meant that 21.8% of Cisco's fiscal 2013 revenue was related to services, up from 21.1% during fiscal 2012.|What's more, Cisco also reported that, like IBM, sales growth in emerging margins had slowed. In particular, Cisco's revenue only expanded 3.6% within the Asia Pacific region, or APJC, during 2012, down from growth of 13.4% during fiscal 2012. Moreover, Cisco's APJC sales as a percentage of total sales fell to 16% during fiscal 2013, down from 16.3% during fiscal 2012.

First, they can use a private branch exchange, or PBX. This technology allows companies to connect all of their phone lines into a single box, which is connected with the carrier provider. The PBX market is currently dominated by Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) , which enjoys a 27% market share. Second, companies can also rely on communication software, such as Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Skype or Lync, which can be integrated to the company's PBX.|There is a third way, which involves upgrading the PBX to a new technology called voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP. Cisco calls this an IP PBX system, because it integrates the first and second options smoothly. Since VoIP allows communications and media sessions to be transported from one place to another using the Internet, it's cheap, safe, and robust. BroadSoft makes this possible by selling its product to carriers, such as AT&T and Verizon, and cable companies, like Comcast.|The best part of BroadSoft's product is that it leads to a profitable win-win situation. By creating a cloud-based infrastructure to support VoIP, BroadSoft can reduce cost expenses, and therefore charge less, satisfying most customers. By selling the product via carriers and cable companies, BroadSoft gives them a chance to control the customer. This is fundamental. As buy-side analyst Josh Burwick notes, carriers are more willing to have their customers use BroadSoft's technology, because if customers go for Microsoft or Cisco, the business interacts with them every day. In this case, Cisco and Microsoft have the business relationship instead of the carrier.|Microsoft's Skype, for example, has a strong user base, but it was not designed for enterprises. Aware of this, Microsoft launched Lync, which is geared toward business use. Notice, however, that Microsoft's products are not complete substitutes to BroadSoft's offerings. There's an increasing consumption pattern among businesses: installing BroadSoft technology as PBX, and on top of it, using Lync and Skype for call controls. Tech giant Cisco may be threatened by BroadSoft. With 40% of its revenue coming from switches, Cisco not only has scale advantages, but also the ability to cross-sell its PBX technology to businesses that already bought its routing and switching solutions.|What a Fool believesBroadSoft's main competitive advantage is its win-win licensed-based business model. Carriers have an incentive to promote BroadSoft against Cisco or Microsoft solutions, because BroadSoft is basically a tool that allows them to own the customer. This could help BroadSoft to indirectly capture most of the market, which has promising prospects due to an increasing interest in systems that combine PBX and VoIP technologies.|Overall, BroadSoft's core competence and fundamentals look strong enough to consider investing in it. There's even an upside scenario that implies an acquisition of this promising company by either Microsoft or Cisco.

Given mixed results from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Merck (NYSE: MRK) , investors will look for signs of whether Pfizer can outperform its rivals.|Investors expect Pfizer to post modest gains in earnings from the year-ago quarter, even though Pfizer will likely suffer revenue declines even worse than those Merck reported earlier today. Patent-cliff issues have hurt players throughout the industry, but Pfizer has an advantage over Merck and Johnson & Johnson in that Pfizer's pipeline is among the healthiest in the business. With more than six dozen different prospects in its pipeline as of August, Pfizer just needs some of those drug candidates to pan out in order to replace revenue from drugs whose patents have expired or will expire in the near future.|Johnson & Johnson's results a couple of weeks ago show just how much potential the pharmaceutical industry has. J&J managed to boost its drug-segment revenue by almost 10% globally, with strong sales from blockbusters Zytiga and Remicade providing a big boost and leading J&J to increase its guidance for the full year.

It's a good thing for Merck investors that old, reliable immunology therapy Remicade continues to perform strongly. Remicade has been a wonder drug for both Merck and partner Johnson & Johnson, and the drug's sales jumped 17% in the third quarter.

Yes, Merck beat Wall Street expectations for its third-quarter earnings per share, notching $0.92 (ex-items) versus a consensus estimate of $0.88. However, it's the manner in which the company achieved the "beat" and the future outlook that concern investors.|Cost management, rather than revenue growth, was instrumental to the earnings beat -- revenue declined 4% year on year to $11 billion, short of Wall Street's $11.1 billion estimate. Moreover, revenue for type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, Merck's top seller, fell 5%; investors can expect more of the same in the future as six treatments that could compete with the drug may come to market over the next two years. This is the same drug the company said it would channel more of its resources into in an effort to please investors.|Merck has struggled to convince investors of the case for investing in its stock.

But revenue of $11.03 billion came in below what investors had hoped to see, as poor sales of Merck's Januvia diabetes drug added to the continued loss of revenue from the now off-patent asthma treatment Singulair to produce an overall 4% drop in sales from the year-ago quarter.|Revenue declines were seen across the board, as pharmaceutical sales dropped 4%, revenue from its animal-health division fell 2%, and consumer-care sales declined 2%. Adverse currency impacts were responsible for about two percentage points of Merck's revenue declines. Within the pharmaceutical area, sales of Singulair fell by more than half, while Januvia saw a 5% drop in sales. Encouraging double-digit revenue gains from HPV-drug Gardasil and rheumatoid arthritis treatment Remicade weren't enough to pull up Merck's overall results.|Still, CEO Kenneth Frazier was upbeat. Frazier cited "strong contributions from our vaccine, immunology and HIV businesses, and effective cost management" in its financial results, and specifically noted the FDA's granting of breakthrough-therapy status to the MK-5172/MK-8742 combination treatment for hepatitis C as an encouraging development during the quarter.

Let's catch up on what you need to know.|Merck's earnings take a tumbleMerck didn't light up any investors' eyes with its most recent quarterly results. The company's revenue dipped 4% year over year to miss analyst expectations, and Merck's profit plunged a far more troubling 35%, although the $0.92-per-share earnings figure did manage to top analyst expectations.|Merck tightened up its full-year financial guidance, but the biggest red flag of the company's release was in the details. Its top-selling diabetes drug, Januvia, once projected to be Merck's flagship product for this decade, has seen its growth stall out. Januvia sales fell 5% year over year in the quarter. When paired with sister drug Janumet, the duo lost 1% relative to 2012's third quarter.|What happened? Januvia and Janumet are seeing competition ramping up in the highly coveted diabetes market, and Januvia has also come under fire lately after researchers singled out the drug, along with a competitor, for an inconclusive risk of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis in patients. Investors shouldn't worry too much about Januvia's safety profile -- it's a well-established drug that still had $2 billion in sales alone over the first six months of the year -- but they should raise an eyebrow over Merck's inability to keep this top seller growing.|With patent-cliff-related sales declines still hitting this company's revenue hard, it's critical for Merck that Januvia and other strong drugs with plenty of patent exclusivity left mitigate potential revenue pitfalls. That didn't happen this quarter, and Merck investors need to hope the company turns things around by the end of the year. Merck's stock had only advanced about 2% over the past 52 weeks before today.|Investors are hoping Pfizer won't fall to the same demons that hit Merck, but it's no question that the loss of patent exclusivity on former best-seller Lipitor will continue to hang over Pfizer's head this earnings season. Lipitor's sales have been slashed by more than half over the first half of the year, and Pfizer's been unable to compensate fully for the decline with growth from the likes of current top-selling drug Lyrica.|Big pharma's dividend advantagePfizer and Merck have made investors pull their hair out in frustration over falling sales due to the patent cliff, but there's one area these stocks have always excelled in: Consistently paying out some of the highest-yielding dividends on the Dow.

Merck reported earnings before the opening bell today, and investors came away disappointed from the get-go: While the company did manage to top Wall Street's earnings estimates, its profits still nosedived by 35% for the quarter.|Generic competition's still taking a big bite out of Merck's performance, but one of the company's brightest hopes for the future has led today's drop in this blue chip stock, as shares fell around 2.5% at the opening of the trading day. Here are the three keys from Merck's earnings release that you need to know.|Januvia's ongoing disappointmentBlockbuster diabetes star Januvia holds the keys to Merck's future, but this standout drug isn't performing like a foundation of the company. Januvia, first approved in 2006, saw its sales slide 5% in the third quarter. The combination of Januvia and Janumet, its sister drug for treating diabetes, slipped 1% overall, down from a 5% growth mark a year ago.|Januvia and Janumet are still huge revenue gainers for Merck. The two drugs combined for more than $2.8 billion over the first half of the year, but in that time frame, Januvia has struggled with falling sales. Stiffening competition is rising in the diabetes market, particularly with the approval of Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) diabetes therapy Invokana. Invokana looks to threaten Januvia and Janumet's strong position in this market, and Johnson & Johnson's drug has performed well against the former in past clinical trials.|Johnson & Johnson's Invokana could rack up $1 billion or more in annual peak sales, and while that's far less than Januvia and Janumet bring in, Merck needs to restore growth in this drug duo to tap into the growing and lucrative diabetes market -- and to keep the company's sales on track for the future.|Mounting concerns from the patent cliffWhy is Januvia so important to Merck's future? Look no further than the patent cliff, which continues to hammer away at the company's results.|Singulair, once Merck's top-selling drug, has continued its fall from grace after losing its patent protection. The drug's sales fell 53% in the quarter, a slight bit better than the more than 75% year-over-year sales loss the drug took over the first half of the year -- although a respite that likely won't satisfy investors frustrated with Merck's weak financial performance of late.|Singulair's the big loser right now, but more patent pain's on the way for Merck. Generic versions of Zetia -- Merck's cholesterol-fighting drug that brought in more than $1.2 billion through the first half of the year -- will be clear to hit the market in December 2016. Allergy medicine Nasonex loses its formulation patent in the U.S. next year, a bad sign for a drug that made more than $700 million over the first six months of the year. Vytorin, another top cholesterol fighter, will lose patent protection in 2017 after scoring more than $800 million in revenues through that same time frame.|Januvia and Janumet were expected to help make up for these losses, but with Merck's signature diabetes duo struggling, patent losses loom much larger in the company's future. And if Singulair's current predicament is any indicator, the results won't be good for investors.|Signs of light in the darkEven in the darkness, Merck showed some signs of life in the third quarter.|HPV vaccine Gardasil, one of Merck's stronger-selling drugs over the recent past, continues to shine brightly. Gardasil's sales jumped by 15% year-over-year to $665 million in the third quarter. That puts the drug well over the $1 billion mark in revenue for the year through nine months and continues strong growth shown through the first six months of the year.|Gardasil can't pick up all of the slack from Januvia's slowdown and patent expirations, however. It's a good thing for Merck investors that old, reliable immunology therapy Remicade continues to perform strongly. Remicade has been a wonder drug for both Merck and partner Johnson & Johnson, and the drug's sales jumped 17% in the third quarter. That's remarkable growth for one of the best-selling drugs in the world, and while Johnson & Johnson reaps most of Remicade's sales, Merck's still profiting from this therapy's timeless performance.|Don't expect Remicade to go away soon, either. While the drug's patent expires this decade, biologics like Remicade have been harder for generic drugmakers to copy in the past. Right now, Remicade looks like a strong option to keep performing well for Merck into the future.|Merck's future in doubtUltimately, however, Remicade, Gardasil, and other growing drugs right now don't have enough firepower to account for Januvia and Janumet's disappointing sales slowdown. Combined with the patent cliff poised to strike over the next few years (and already in full force with Singulair), Januvia and Janumet's petering out will have big consequences for investors if Merck can't turn around these top franchises.|Investors will have to wait and see whether Merck's R&D division, currently in the midst of a recently announced makeover, will be able to inject life into a lackluster pipeline. Until then, Merck's outlook appears murky. This company has a giant portfolio of products, but too many are at risk of sales losses soon or lack the sales punch to impress investors. Even Merck's usually-reliable animal health division saw its sales drop this quarter due to drug concerns.|If Merck can't right this ship soon, criticism over the company's direction -- and its stock's tepid performance over the past 52 weeks -- will only intensify.|Can Merck keep up with the market's top dividend stocks?Merck's growth might be in doubt, but investors have always loved its high-yielding dividend. Why? Dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. Over the long term, the compounding effect of the quarterly payouts, as well as their growth, adds up faster than most investors imagine.

The team has this to say about their recommendation:|"We rate Merck & Co (MRK) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins.

The Mexican government is attempting to crack down on soft drink and junk food consumption by its citizens by imposing a tax on these food items. The tax adds about eight cents to the price of every liter of soft drinks, and a separate tax increases the price of snack foods by 5%.

In the U.S., Coca-Cola has as much as 42% share of the total soft drink market, while PepsiCo's market share is around 28.1%. However, the majority of PepsiCo's profit and growth come from its snack business, not from the beverage business.|Coca-Cola enhances its leading position in the beverage businessWhile PepsiCo's product portfolio is more diversified with the snack and beverage businesses, Coca-Cola has kept its focus on strategies to enhance its leadership position in both carbonated soft drink and the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink market. In the third quarter, the company reported sequential volume growth for the 25th consecutive quarter. Its flagship brand Coca-Cola grew by 2% in the quarter as well, indicating the brand's strength on a global scale.|Because of the 2% global volume growth, Coca-Cola was able to deliver 181 billion servings in the quarter. Muhtar Kent, the chairman and CEO, said that the company was on track to reach its 2020 Vision of doubling its business from its 2010 base. Coca-Cola believed that there would be a lot of potential growth in the market due to increasing urbanization, growing disposable income, and the rising middle class. With its well-established global distribution network and global leading position, Coca-Cola is in the right position to take advantage of those favorable macro trends to grow its business.

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) have also struggled among the consumer backlash. BevNET reports that all three companies have experienced high-single-digit percentage declines in the troubled category.|Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are relatively better positioned for American consumers' secular shift away from carbonated soft drinks. Both companies have a large presence in emerging markets -- the prime source of growth in the industry. Meanwhile, Dr Pepper Snapple is concentrated in the United States and Canada, neither of which is an outlet for growth. As a result, Dr Pepper Snapple expects no year-over-year revenue growth in 2013.|Dr Pepper Snapple is also a distant third to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in North American market share. Coca-Cola maintains a 40% share of the market, PepsiCo a 30% share, and Dr Pepper Snapple a 16% share. Moreover, Dr Pepper Snapple has increased its share of the market by just two percentage points in the last decade -- hardly a pace that will make up for slowing industry growth.|Bottom lineCoca-Cola will continue expanding its carbonated soft-drink business in emerging markets, PepsiCo will leverage its Frito Lay division to offset weakness in the domestic carbonated soft-drink market, and Dr Pepper Snapple will attempt to grow per-capita consumption of its top brands to pick up market share in a tough domestic market. Each company has a different method of coping with the industry's struggles in North America, but none has an impossible task at hand.

Yet in the long run, SodaStream earnings appear poised to keep soaring, raising questions about whether the home-carbonation system maker will eventually start cannibalizing the businesses of soda giants Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) .|SodaStream jumped onto a kitchen appliance trend, but it has a much different marketing angle from those that home coffee brewers use. SodaStream promises not only cost-effective soda but also healthier offerings that cut down on environmental waste. As sentiment turns against PepsiCo and Coca-Cola for their perceived role in connection with the obesity epidemic in the U.S. and around the world, SodaStream has a unique opportunity to play to consumers' growing desire for healthier food and beverage options. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with SodaStream over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|The key to understanding SodaStream's disruptive capability is that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have relied on consumers' willingness to make repeated trips to stores, lug heavy products home, and deal with the hassle of recycling used bottles and cans. By comparison, SodaStream's business model is simple and efficient, and the company is doing its best to position itself as a tiny game-changer standing up to its two giant competitors.|In the SodaStream earnings report, watch to see how the company's sales of flavors and gas refills fare. As more evidence comes in that users are sticking with their purchases, SodaStream will gain even more leverage against Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2015 expiration for KO. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $27.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 40 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.4% return against the $27.50 commitment, or a 1.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).|Selling a put does not give an investor access to KO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Coca-Cola Co sees its shares fall 30.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $27.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 40 cents from $27.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.2% annualized rate of return.|Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2015 expiration, for shareholders of Coca-Cola Co (KO) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.9% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $45 strike and collecting the premium based on the 85 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 1.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost), for a total of 4.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $45 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but KO shares would have to advance 14.3% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.|The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Coca-Cola Co , highlighting in green where the $27.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $45 strike in red:

Redbox Instant by Verizon|David and Goliath vs. Goliath and GoliathBillions of dollars are spent by Netflix and Amazon to obtain streaming rights for massive libraries. This simply cannot be overcome by Netflix providing a similar, but poorer, service. The group effort of Redbox Instant by Verizon has fallen well short of being viewed as a threat in the streaming marketplace.|The best part about the subscription isn't even having instant streaming, but receiving four movies for use at one of their kiosks. A more strategic approach would have been to focus on the strength of the Redbox kiosks: having the newest DVD content. Translate this focus to the streaming service and they have a niche service. Why compete with Netflix and Amazon in a game they are not willing to lose. A new plan needs to be made to produce a competitive product. Even an on-demand format that can be competitively priced works. Until then, this service will be a drain upon both Outerwall and Verizon.|I believe that Redbox Instant by Verizon does not fit their business plan, and therefore should be sold. The product is far too inferior, and it is simply not worth the money to try to compete with two companies willing to invest billions in themselves. If Outerwall can trim the fat and stay lean while focusing on the segments that work, it will continue to grow to new heights.

Yet at least for now, Sprint earnings aren't expected to go positive for the foreseeable future as conditions in the U.S. wireless market remain as fierce as ever.|Sprint's deal with Softbank essentially rescued the U.S. carrier from irrelevance in the quickly evolving domestic market for wireless services. But with Verizon having taken complete control of its Verizon Wireless division and with AT&T looking to respond with a major strategic action of its own, Sprint needs to get itself in competitive shape as quickly as possible. Is the company up to the job? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Sprint over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Will Sprint finally stand up to Verizon and AT&T? In recent months, analysts have gotten a bit more pessimistic about Sprint's earnings prospects, widening their third-quarter and full-year 2013 projections modestly. The stock has done better, though, rising more than 10% since late July.|Sprint's second-quarter earnings report was bittersweet, as shares rose despite some dire news. The company's quarterly loss was 70% worse than investors had expected, and the company managed to lose more than 1 million contract customers during the quarter. Yet shares rose on the news, with the implication that the results could have been worse. Improving average revenue per user was indeed good news, and AT&T and Verizon both suffered from the realization that Sprint wouldn't disappear anytime soon.|Now, though, it's up to Sprint and Softbank to execute on their plans. Softbank has started with its capital injections in order to allow Sprint to make strategic acquisitions like the purchase of Clearwire. In the long run, though, Softbank hopes to use combined economies of scale to negotiate better deals with smartphone and mobile-device makers, boosting profits or giving Sprint more room to compete on price against Verizon and AT&T.|One contentious area involving the major U.S. carriers has been in coming out with early upgrade plans. AT&T and Verizon followedT-Mobile in giving customers the right to upgrade their devices early in exchange for monthly device payments on existing plans in addition to regular voice and data subscription costs. Last month, Sprint followed with its One Up program, offering the choice of paying for their phones in 24 equal installments, with the right to upgrade after a year. Sprint also offered a $15 monthly discount on several of its service plans to offset the unsubsidized costs of the phones. As a way of weaning Americans off costly subsidies, the plans are a good first step for Sprint and its rivals.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/28/buy-these-grocery-chains.aspx|10/28/2013|1|"Wal-Mart"|2|I'd like to look at how Harris Teeter and Kroger's business models will benefit from this transaction, and the effect of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) on the grocery market in general. This transaction will make Kroger an excellent investment over the long term.|Wal-Mart as a threat to Harris Teeter and other regional grocersHarris Teeter faces a challenging environment in its home theater of North Carolina (where two-thirds of stores are located), with Wal-Mart and privately owned Publix muscling in to seize market share. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart became the No. 1 grocer in Charlotte, a major Harris Teeter market in North Carolina. Wal-Mart has the resources to keep prices low and make a powerful value proposition to consumers. Given the low switching costs among grocery stores, this is a huge threat to Harris Teeter.|Wal-Mart currently has around 290 Neighborhood Market stores in the US; management reportedly intends to expand that to 500 units in the next 18 months. These small-footprint (averaging around 38,000 square feet) stores are intended to directly compete with grocers, pharmacies, and dollar stores. This is a smart capital allocation decision. The traditional big-box format doesn't fit all markets, and smaller stores should be cheaper to build. Grocers, particularly small regional grocers like Harris Teeter, should beware.|After being seemingly stuck in neutral for FY 2011 and 2012 with flat earnings and revenues, Wal-Mart is aggressively seeking market share, and it shows. EPS, for example, climbed 11% to $5.02 in FY 2013 from $4.52 in FY 2012 (EPS was up 5.1% to $1.24 for the second quarter of FY 2014, the most recent quarter for which information is available).|I have a variety of concerns about Wal-Mart as an investment, particularly weak comps (Wal-Mart posed a negative 0.3% comp in its most recent quarter, driven by a 0.5% decrease in traffic). Bad press from the continued battles between union organizers at Walmart and management continues to tarnish the company's image.|Dollar stores pose perhaps the greatest challenge to Wal-Mart as they continue to leach away the demographic that Wal-Mart has traditionally captured: middle-income families on a budget. That said, Wal-Mart remains formidable, and I believe that the firm will make serious inroads in markets traditionally dominated by regional grocers. However, it's not a good investment right now due to the amount of uncertainty these other circumstances generate.|How Kroger can help Harris Teeter fend off Wal-MartHere is where Kroger can make a big difference. As the largest grocery chain in the US, it can bring scale advantages and additional capital resources to protect and increase Harris Teeter's market share in the Southeastern US. Given Kroger's track record of business management, which includes 10 consecutive years of positive comps and eight consecutive years of lowering costs, Harris Teeter will have additional resources and management talent to compete and retain (and grow) market share.|Final thoughtsIf the transaction does not go through for any reason, I worry that Harris Teeter's position will continue to decline relative to Wal-Mart in North Carolina and elsewhere. The firm needs a powerful backer, like Kroger, to preserve and expand market share in the face of such a big competitor.|Kroger is making an excellent investment by purchasing Harris Teeter, an arrangement that will benefit both brands. Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market concept is potentially powerful, particularly in terms of competing with regional grocers, but there are too many negatives to justify an investment in Wal-Mart at this time. Stick with the safe bet: Kroger.

Wal-Mart even ventured into the waters earlier with its Shopycat social gifting service built on top of Facebook that suggests gifts for friends based on their usage of the site. Posts are translated into keywords that are turned into gift ideas, at both Wal-Mart and elsewhere.|While Goodies may have been Wal-Mart's response to test the waters for a food-based subscription service -- not a bad idea considering its position as the world's biggest retailer -- and as a means of challenging Amazon.com, which offers a "Subscribe and Save" shopping service of its own (and earlier had also launched two Facebook apps), it likely really wanted to cull the data it generated from the customers to plug into its Social Genome project.|Ever since buying a bunch of tech startups and pouring them into its R&D division's WalmartLabs, Wal-Mart has been experimenting with concepts in a bid to glean customer insights. In a bit of NSA-like information gathering, its Social Genome project, which it acquired when it bought Kosmix, is described as "the social world -- all the millions and billions of tweets, Facebook messages, blog postings, YouTube videos, and more -- a living organism itself, constantly pulsating and evolving." It wants to tap into and catalog your life, and generate the info into a better shopping experience.|Whereas Target recently launched its Subscription Services feature in direct response to Amazon's continued foray into retailing, Wal-Mart is happy to see what information it can cull from its experiments. In fact, while Shopycat has been a success and lives on, Goodies has already closed its doors, not even a year into the trial.|I don't think it's correct to say the subscription service was a failure; Wal-Mart likely gleaned a lot of customer data from the effort that it will be putting to use in other areas. As the website notice announcing its demise suggests, it's taking what it learned from the project and will "bring a bit of that Goodies magic to the world of Walmart shopping."|Wal-Mart may give the appearance of being only a stodgy retailer, but in reality it is a high-tech company from which we can expect to see, if not cutting-edge advances, leading trends in sales that ought to improve its bottom line down the line.|2 retailers even more forward-thinking than Wal-MartTo learn about two retailers with especially good prospects, take a look at The Motley Fool's special free report: "The Death of Wal-Mart: The Real Cash Kings Changing the Face of Retail."

Its online initiative has been paying off with 30% growth in online sales in the last quarter despite disappointing earnings overall. This year it is doubling the amount of items available on walmart.com to five million-plus, and opening two of its largest online fulfillment centers in Texas and Pennsylvania for a total of 130 distribution centers.

While the two companies have worked together in the past, the partnership sheds light on the future of the connected driver.|Just the facts At Mobilize 2013 a little over a week ago, AT&T's senior vice president of emerging devices, Chris Penrose, said that the company was bringing Internet connectivity to major auto manufacturers including BMW, Nissan, Ford, and Tesla.|Here's what we know: Tesla doesn't use 4G LTE in its vehicles, according to an AT&T spokesperson. Instead, Tesla's agreement with AT&T involves Evolved High-Speed Packet Access, or HSPA+, which is used to power two-way communications, remote diagnostics, navigation, and Internet access in Tesla's cars.|It's interesting that AT&T waited until now to reveal its partnership with Tesla. After all, the EV maker's Model S cars have been equipped with AT&T's Internet and data capabilities since they first hit the road more than a year ago. Nevertheless, it's nice to see AT&T take credit for its role in Tesla's innovative driving experience.|For AT&T, connected cars offer a new growth avenue outside of mobile devices. Earlier this year, AT&T beat out Verizon Wireless for a connectivity contract with General Motors (NYSE: GM) . As part of the deal, AT&T will power GM's OnStar security technology. Additionally, by next year AT&T's 4G LTE network will be integrated across various GM brands including Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.|The future of connectivityThe connected car is the next big thing in the auto industry. In fact, by 2016 more than half of all new cars globally will have factory-installed telematics, according to ABI Research. That's up from just 10% in 2011. And AT&T is at the forefront of this technological shift. Looking to the future, AT&T hopes its in-vehicle technology will make cars safer. Vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, for example, may be able to warn a nearby car of a possible collision or notify emergency personnel when airbags deploy.|Today, the evolution of the connected car is just getting started, and AT&T should continue to benefit from its relationships with auto manufacturers.|If I don't have my service through AT&T I'm not going to pay for a new contract. In fact I would rate a car lower if it couldn't use my current device. Look back 10 years and see if you would want to be tethered to that technology. Bluetooth and WiFi will be backwards compatible but 4G LTE will be replaced at least twice by then.

That's because dividend stocks can make you rich. It's as simple as that. While they don't garner the notability of high-flying growth stocks, they're also less likely to crash and burn.

The American Society for Testing and Materials, or ASTM, recently established ASTM D7862, which defines performance requirements and testing methods for a variety of characteristics of butanol-blended fuel. It's a giant step towards the creation of a national butanol industry that will help producers such as BP (NYSE: BP) and DuPont (NYSE: DD) , gasoline blenders such as Valero (NYSE: VLO) , pipeline managers such as Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) , and drivers like you and me in a number of ways.|What it means for isobutanol producersThe two biggest names in bio-isobutanol are Gevo and Butamax, a joint venture between BP and DuPont. Each has developed a novel platform capable of producing isobutanol from a variety of sugars using yeast.|Yeast, sugars, corn -- that should sound familiar. Rather than spend hundreds of millions of dollars building new commercial facilities, each platform can be implemented at existing corn ethanol facilities. Theoretically, the nation's excess ethanol capacity -- about 1 billion gallons per year -- could be converted into 820 million gallons of isobutanol in less than one year of retrofitting. That would represent one heck of a growth spurt and an annual revenue stream worth billions of dollars for BP, DuPont, and Gevo. While end products would likely be focused on high value chemicals rather than fuels at first, ASTM D7862 is an important first step toward the gas tank.|Foolish bottom lineButanol is now clear for takeoff, which firmly establishes a massive market opportunity for isobutanol companies such as DuPont, BP, and Gevo. The fuel can benefit from the same laws and credits that supported ethanol's rise to the top of the blending ladder -- and even qualifies for higher next-generation subsidies in many cases. Further, drop-in capabilities in existing infrastructure throughout the production chain should facilitate a nearly seamless transition into the nation's fuel supply.|DuPont Management has been struggling to develop and commercialise corn cob "gasoline" for nearly a decade (bad-mileage ethanol refined from corn stover).

Despite hopes that the Arctic might open up new horizons for ExxonMobil, the challenge of constantly finding and acquiring assets has taken its toll on Exxon's growth.

Early finger-pointing suggested that the Oracle Identity Manager was a cause of the major technical problems. That prompted Oracle to strongly deny that its software wasn't working.|To his credit, UnitedHealth's Andrew Slavitt stated that Quality Software Services took accountability for the account creation function.

He indicated that these problems were reported to the contractor and to the federal agency directing the efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.|Both Campbell from CGI and Slavitt from UnitedHealth agreed on one culprit for the exchange problems: the CMS. Campbell said that the federal agency had the "ultimate responsibility" for the exchange.

Quality Software Services is part of UnitedHealth's OptumInsight business unit, which reported more than $2.88 billion in revenue last year -- much of it from the U.S. government. Is pointing the finger at a huge customer a smart business move for these two companies? If not, should investors stay away?|In answer to the first question, I would argue that CGI and UnitedHealth are actually playing it smart. This is an exceptional case, though. Normally, a business shouldn't bite the hand that feeds it. However, remember that the U.S. government is a multi-headed beast. Contracts with each federal agency are negotiated separately. And those agencies don't always get along with each other.|As for the second question, I don't think the ongoing debacle will make a difference for either of these companies -- and certainly not for Equifax, Oracle, or Serco. CGI shares traded higher after Cheryl Campbell's appearance before the committee and isn't down much since the exchanges launched on Oct. 1. UnitedHealth's stock is down over 5% since the launch, but that's more related to a disappointing earnings announcement than anything else.|UnitedHealth isn't as much of a value play. However, it's the largest health insurer in the nation and boasts a high-growth business with Optum. UnitedHealth has also expanded into Latin America, another nice growth opportunity.

But something was happening; that growth was slowing.|The thinking was pretty simple: Food was just a ploy to get more customers in Wal-Mart's doors. People would come to buy groceries, but while they were there, they would also purchase other goods. Wal-Mart could offer groceries for less because it would rely more heavily on increased merchandise sales for profit, while offering the groceries for razor-thin margins.|Back then, Wal-Mart accounted for just 4% of all grocery purchases in the United States. It had devoted 4 million square feet at its distribution centers to food items. But over the next decade, that number increased ninefold.|Today, Wal-Mart devotes almost 35 million square feet at its distribution centers to food. And the proportion of nationwide grocery purchases made at Wal-Mart stores has exploded to a mind-boggling 25%. That's right: One out of every four food purchases in our country today happens inside of a Wal-Mart, and much of that has been at the expense of traditional grocers nationwide.|Since these two disparate movements started, others have joined in. Targethas joined Wal-Mart in offering conventionally grown food for cheaper than other grocery stores can afford. Whole Foodshas been joined by the likes of Trader Joe's (among others), which would have placed just behind Whole Foods in the list above if it were publicly traded.|And in the middle, many traditional grocers have been feeling the pinch. The "Whole Foods Clan" has taken away high-end shoppers who are looking for the healthiest options. And the "Wal-Mart Clan" has stolen away the bargain hunters who want the cheapest prices they can find on food.

Interestingly, this valuation does not seem pricey at all compared to larger grocery retailers Kroger (NYSE: KR) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) . Kroger, at nearly $22.4 billion market value, trades at around 6.44 times its EV/EBITDA. Wal-Mart is the most expensive among the three, trading at 8.04 times its EV/EBITDA.|Previously, what made me worry is Safeway's high leverage ratio. Its debt/EBITDA ratio has stayed above three, while Kroger's leverage ratio is only 0.16. Wal-Mart's debt/EBITDA is quite compatible with the industry average at 1.76. Interestingly, both Wal-Mart and Kroger have also repurchased significant amounts of their shares from the market in the past.|In the past four quarters, Kroger returned more than $920 million to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends. In the second quarter, Wal-Mart paid out $1.5 billion in dividends and bought back $1.9 billion worth of shares. In its $15 billion buyback authorization Wal-Mart still has as much as $13.9 billion remaining, which accounts for 5.6% of its current market value.

Among the 30 major brands studied in American Banker's 2013 Survey of bank reputations, Bank of America came in dead last. In addition to having the worst reputation among its own customers, it scored the lowest among non-customers as well.|This is not to say that Bank of America is simply a carbon copy of its too-big-to-fail brethren. Unlike a Citigroup (NYSE: C) or Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) , both of which cater to ostensibly sophisticated institutional investors and corporations, Bank of America looks to the average consumer to fill its coffers. It has a staggering 48 million households as customers, equating to 45%, or nearly half, of all American households with bank accounts. A purported 8 million are designated as "preferred," meaning that they generate more money for the bank via higher deposit balances and product usage, while the remaining 40 million customers are classified as "retail."|One way to understand the institution's behavior would be to look at the work of Hannah Arendt. The German-American political theorist, whose analysis of bureaucracy is second-to-none, observed in The Banality of Evil that most damage isn't committed by sadists, but rather by ordinary people acting through bureaucratic institutions that normalize and systematize bad behavior. "Most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil." Various psychology experiments -- most famously Stanley Milgram's Obedience to Authority -- have since confirmed that ordinary people will do awful things if you put them in the right situation.|In 2007 I loved Bank of America and believed it to be the best bank. By 2011 I had joined the ranks of those who hate the bank and believe it has literally fallen apart at the seams. Nothing happened with our portfolio, net worth, or income. In fact, during that time when the nation was experiencing economic turmoil, our finances were steady and strong. So, why would I despise the bank? It lied about who really owned my mortgage, on which I was paid up years ahead (and unlike many Americans never even remotely underwater). After investigating thoroughly, I figured out that the mortgage had been rolled into one of the bank's packaged products to be "sliced and diced" and sold to investors. Since I was helping prop up the "investment package" of course the bank wanted to keep me from refinancing and learning the truth about who really owned the mortgage. Then the bank's HSA department and its Merrill Lynch departments both messed up tax reporting that caused us an audit, which ended with the IRS acknowledging that we made no mistakes and did not owe Uncle Sam one more single dime and that the bank was at fault. I could go on with other mishaps involving stupid bankers who clearly never learned the basics of addition, subtraction, and honesty. By 2011, I was looking to return to my former credit union and for a new locally owned bank to do business with. Truly amazing how quickly BofA set out to destroy itself.|The authors are fairly clueless, the article stinks. BAC made 1/3 of all commercial loans last year. 50% of Americans still have a banking arrangement here. The number of banks is just under 6000 now and continues to dwindle. That leaves the largest banks in a fantastic position to make more money for us shareholders long term. Ken Lewis was an egotistical idiot. Brian is a good guy who is on the right track. Give him a break he is changing the culture here for the better.|Besides being bailed out by taxpayers who are still suffering as a result of the deregulated banks whose unpunished banking fraud and greed cost Americans $15 trillion in household wealth, 4+ million lost homes, 9 million homes underwater, and 9 million jobs, American Express was one of the winners from the Bush-Cheney-GOP change of the bankruptcy laws that benefitted not consumers but the banks and credit card companies. The GOP claimed that cardholders were abusing their credit when in fact when the law was passed most bankruptcies were due to overwhelming medical and hospital bills.|The 4 Walton heirs are worth as much as the combined wealth of 115 MILLION Americans-42% of America's population. The top 10% now control 82% of ALL Assets in this country, up from about 45% under Reagan. The last time this happened, the Great Depression followed, largely as a result of 9 people who were able to manipulate the New York Stock Exchange thanks to Deregulated "Laissez Faire, Free Market, Buyer Beware" government allowed business practices..|I just read Tingall's comments about HSBC aka Household Bank, household finance, etc. This bank has been corrupt from the days before people had hair. My step dad was a senior bank examiner for the State Of Oklahoma. I remember him warning me to NEVER do business with Household finance, which was the only business they operated in Oklahoma at the time. My step dad was VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO "Branch banking" ever becoming legalized in this state, but enough money changed hands between the mega bank lobbies and the legislature that it happened. I do have an account with Bank Of Oklahoma, which has probably 100 branches counting mini banks in supermarkets, etc. BOK's CEO is George Kaiser, worth about $10 BIllion. Goerge, who has probably given away at least $10 BILLION more lives in town in a pretty modest home and has done more than anybody in the state to promote health care for children. George Kaiser is about #30 on Forbes Billionaires list, but he is the 3rd most generous giver in the United States behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. Before he bought the troubled BOK financial a few years back, George was a very successful oilman, and he still is. He went to the state legislature about 3 years ago and BEGGED the legislature NOT to give away billions of dollars in welfare payments to oil companies, but to at least earmark a substantial amount of the money for Childrens' health. He said "what I am asking you to do will cost me and my company a lot of money, but we DON"T NEED THE MONEY. The children of Oklahoma need and deserve it." Unfortunately, in 2010, the Koch brothers bought the Governor, Attorney General, Insurance Commissioner, Labor commissioner and EVERY elected office outside the legislature in this state. The Koch Brothers are the sons of John Birch Society co-founder Fred Koch. The Birchers were viewed as Nuts and Fruitcakes in the 1960's, held in the same high esteem as the American Nazi Party, which shared many common beliefs In the 1970's, TRUE CONSERVATIVE William F Buckley called the Birchers "Radical and Dangerous." and warned that they should NEVER be allowed to gain a foothold in our political system.

This move is brilliant, and frankly, it's absolutely horrible news for any other defense contractor that wanted to win the bomber contract. Here's what else you need to know.|Titans of defense In the defense world, there's no bigger name than Lockheed. It's the top dog when it comes to defense revenue. However, Boeing closely follows it. Moreover, both companies have had their fair share of experience when it comes to planes. Plus, they've both won some of the Air Force's most expensive, and thereby lucrative, contracts -- Boeing won the KC-46 tanker contract, and Lockheed won the F-35 contract.|Now, they've teamed up to win the Air Force's next-generation stealth bomber. More specifically, Boeing will be the prime contractor, and Lockheed the primary subcontractor, according to Reuters. This move is probably unwelcome news for Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) which has also said it plans to bid on the new bomber.|Boeing and Lockheed's teaming is a serious threat to any other defense contract that's hoping to win the bomber contract, but that doesn't mean other defense contractors don't stand a chance. For example, if Northrop teamed up with EADS' Airbus, that would also be a teaming of the titans -- plus, they've teamed up in the past. There's no word that that will happen, but if Northrop is smart, it'll look into it. As they say, it's not over till the fat lady sings. Still, Boeing and Lockheed's teaming up is something to watch.

In 2012, the company added 1.4 million acres of exploration acreage in the South China Sea and averaged a net daily production of 20,000 barrels of crude oil in China. For 2013, the company's capital and exploratory expense was budgeted at $36.7 billion. About $25.5 billion is for major development projects located outside the U.S. in countries like China.|During the period of 2008 to 2012, the oil-equivalent production in China was fairly stable and ranged from a low of 19,000 to a high of 22,000 barrels per day. Net liquids production during this period showed similar results. Chevron's oil and gas acreage has seesawed since 2008, reaching a peak of 4.8 million in 2010 and taking a dive to 2012's gross acreage amount of 1.7 million. The continued search for acreage will be critical for the company to remain competitive.|In 2012, the company also added nearly 1.8 million net acres to its exploration portfolio. Between 2013 and 2017, Exxon plans to bring 28 major new projects online, which are expected to deliver about 1 million in net oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2017. Like Chevron, Exxon also confirms the growing oil demand in China, which the company states had an annual growth rate of 15% between 1990 and 2010. Exxon predicts that demand will double during the current decade.

The chemical and seed maker has struggled growing over the past year, but it finally showed growth on both the top and bottom line. Revenue rose 5% to $7.8 billion, and net income was $285 million. After one-time items were taken out, earnings per share were $0.45, four cents ahead of estimates. DuPont is also looking at strategic alternatives for its performance chemicals business, including a possible spinoff. This isn't a growth stock by any means, but investors looking for a steady dividend should feel a little better about their investment after last quarter's results.|Fellow FOOLS, the big news coming out of Fortress Wilmington in the week just past? DuPont's big bosses are expunging what made DuPont unique and innovative for 211 years, in short chemicals. Seems Ms. Kullman, DuPont Chieftess, prefers to run exclusively what she calls "a science-based food, fuel, and protection" boutique. To this end, she is splitting the historically poorly managed DuPont conglomerate into two poorly managed parts, with chemicals such as Teflon, TIO2, acids, and fluorochemicals dumped into one spin-off. Despite her public pleas of "urgency", the job won't get done for another year and a half. 18 months is apparently "urgent" by the standards of this lumbering, behind-the-times conglomerate which calls as home the dwarf state of Delaware.|In dumping chemicals, Ms. Kullman is getting rid of nearly a third of her earnings and 20% of DuPont revenues based on the last full year, 2012. That's a fat $1.6 billion in PTOI, or 28.3% of total DuPont PTOI to be exact, and $7 billion in revenue.|To pump up enthusiasm, the head of DuPont dispatched her CFO, Nicholas Fanandakis, to brag to the media, the segregated chemicals unit would be a "strong" stand-alone chemical company. What? At only an eighth the size of Dow Chemical, and less than a 10th the size of BASF, the amputated DuPont chemicals unit is hardly going to be a major global player, no matter how much public relations fluff is scattered to the winds of the media!

But there's almost certainly one other large transaction still ahead.|The real question concerning the company, however, is precisely where it's headed. For the moment, there remain those who are inclined to compare it first with Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) , which while operating an agriculture unit, remains largely a chemicals concern. However, DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman and her team have guided their company toward a significantly increased emphasis on agriculture, nutrition, and related areas, a la Monsanto (NYSE: MON) .|In 2011, DuPont paid $6.3 billion, including debt assumptions, for Danisco, a Danish company (as its name would imply) involved in enzymes and specialty foods.|In July, following a lengthy three-year process, DuPont acquired an 80% interest in South Africa's Pannar Seed. DuPont plans to plow significant research and development funding into the unit in an effort to bring about meaningful improvements in agricultural science on the continent.|Still headed higher?What does all this mean for those who might be considering purchasing DuPont shares? To arrive at something of an empirical indication, let's compare DuPont to the aforementioned Monsanto and Dow Chemical. In the most recent quarter, DuPont's agriculture and related segments accounted for 36% of total corporate revenues. Without performance chemicals in the mix, that share would have risen to 46%.|At Monsanto, agricultural products make up virtually all of the company's revenues. But Dow Chemical's third quarter report on Thursday indicated that agriculture constitutes just 10% of its total revenues. As to respective valuations, DuPont trades at about a 14 times forward earnings, similar to Dow, but well below the 18.3-times forward multiple accorded to Monsanto.|Given DuPont's headlong drive to boost agriculture's share of its operations, along with an avowed determination to take an appropriate action with its performance chemicals laggard, it appears logical to anticipate that, in a 2015-2016 time frame, agriculture could constitute 65% to 75% of the company's total sales, likely moving its valuation closer to Monsanto's.|Foolish takeawayOn that basis, and despite a 31% jump in its shares year to date, I see little reason to suggest that Fools shouldn't carefully consider initiating or adding to positions in venerable, but rapidly changing, DuPont.|Obviously there was little excitement about the announcement of the split-up of the once mighty DuPont Company yesterday, Oct. 25, 2013. DuPont Chieftess, Ellen Kullman, was likely forced to take down the "FOR SALE" sign for the chemicals she was insistent on dumping because she found no willing buyers at what was probably an exorbitant price given the towering legal, pension, and environmental liabilities in the package. Ms. Kullman's numbers man, DuPont CFO, Nicholas Fanandakis disingenuously alleged that taking chemicals off the market was to avoid any capital gains tax on a sale.|It's much too late for Ms. Ellen Kullman, DuPont Chieftess to pull off a copycat of Monsanto. The original Monsanto spun off its chemicals business into a separate entity, Solutia, back 13 years ago at the turn of the century. In the interim through savvy risk taking and brilliant research, Monsanto has grown rapidly to become the leading innovator in seeds and the largest seed enterprise on the globe.|Ms. Kullman and her TEAM are not likely ever to catch up and replicate the high success of Monsanto because Monsanto is too far head in biotechnology. Moreover the lumbering DuPont conglomerate bureaucracy lacks the intense focus and pool of scientific and managerial talent to get the job done.

The Swoosh recently laid out a bold plan to reach $36 billion in sales by fiscal year 2017, a more than 40% increase from fiscal 2013. Nike said it expects $20 billion of those sales to come from North America and Western Europe, where it sees high-single-digit growth, and most of the rest to come from developing markets, including China and Eastern Europe, where it sees growth in the low double digits. It expects e-commerce sales to nearly double to $8 billion.|In its presentation, Nike noted that the middle-class population in the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) will expand by 1 billion over the next decade, and also remarked that sports like running and basketball have never seen more interest around the world. Nike was also optimistic about the effect that hosting the World Cup and Summer Olympics would have on Brazil, a sport-loving country with a population of 200 million.|Under Armour and Lululemon are much more focused on the North American market than Nike, but Nike was similarly optimistic about its home region, noting that sales have grown there by 40% over the last three years even as naysayers said that that market had already reached maturity.|As Under Armour competes in many of the same categories as Nike, it will likely benefit from any market expansion in North America as demand for sports and exercise apparel increases.|Wearable technologyThough readers may think of Google Glass or smart watches when they hear the phrase "wearable technology," companies like Nike and Under Armour are just as much a part of this transformative shift. With its Nike+ family of products such as its Fuelband, the sneaker king is taking performance measurement to the next level. The wristband tracks athletic activity, the intensity of your workout, and even monitors your sleep, giving you a Fuel score based on your total activity. The product is just one component of Nike+ , which the company calls "an ecosystem of digital products and experiences designed to measure, motivate, and empower you to improve," Above all, Nike+ and the Fuelband serve as an example of an entirely new category Nike has been able to create simply by harnessing technological advances.|Stocks that are ready to rule the worldThe global marketplace represents a huge opportunity for Nike, Lululemon, and Under Armour. With a billion new middle-class consumers sprouting up over the next decade, these companies could have a field day. In fact, The Motley Fool recently named Nike as one of "3 American Companies Set to Dominate the World."

While both companies are fighting against the patent cliff, each has its own challenges and hopes ahead.|Merck's struggling with a retooling after announcing it will cut back its extensive research and development division, a costly endeavor that some investors have called to be pared in the recent past. Merck's own pipeline has struggled to impress lately, and while Wall Street isn't expecting much this earnings season, this company needs to show it's on the right path to success. Pfizer, meanwhile, boasts of a strong pipeline headed forward, but can its potential blockbuster drugs, such as blood thinner Eliquis and inflammatory treatment Xeljanz, impress investors after a rocky 2013 so far?|Find out in the video below, where Fool contributor Dan Carroll tells you what to look for when Merck and Pfizer announce their earnings next week and what the roads ahead for each of these companies could hold.|Which dividend stock is right for your portfolio?Merck and Pfizer are two of the Dow's top dividend stocks, but they aren't the only blue chips that will light up income investors' eyes.

Their dividends grow almost every year. The consumer staples sector is much loved for its reliability of dividends. An ETF in this category is the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEMKT: VDC) , up 23.66% year to date and a dividend yield of 2.5%.|Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF is non-leveraged, so investors don't have the added risk of debt in the fund. The fund's top three holdings are Procter & Gamble, 12.28%, Coca-Cola, 8.87%, and Phillip Morris International, 8.14%.|Procter & Gamble|Consumer product warsProcter & Gamble towers over its competitors with its 300 products like Tide and its massive market capitalization at $219 billion. This is one of the mostly widely held stocks in the world. But it almost seems too big. It's hard to grow revenues at this level. A smaller more nimble company like Church & Dwight can bolt-on acquisitions that make a difference to its bottom line.|With a $58.8 billion market cap, Colgate-Palmolive is much smaller than Procter & Gamble. Colgate-Palmolive has many things going for it, including 7.5% sales growth in the third quarter in Asia, which represents 14% of total sales. Company sales in Europe and the South Pacific were up 1.5% in the third quarter, while Latin American, which represents nearly a third of company sales, declined 2%. US sales were up 1%. Colgate's Hill's Pet Nutrition division, which represents 12% of company sales, achieved 3% sales growth during third quarter 2013.

The split will allow each person to focus more acutely on the responsibilities of each role.|The proposal was made by current Chairman and CEO Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal, who has since been ratified as the board's executive chairman. The new CEO will be Carlos Salazar Lomelin, who until his appointment was CEO of Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF) , the producer and distributor of Coca-Cola products throughout Latin America. He served in that capacity for the past 14 years.|Moving into the position of CEO of Coca-Cola FEMSA is the company's COO of the South America Division, John Santa Maria Otazua, a position he has held since 2000. He has been with the bottler for 18 years.|Calling Otazua a "visionary" during his tenure with the company, Lomelin said, "In his new role, the company will remain committed to the creation of long-term value within the beverage industry and will continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Coca-Cola system."
http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2013/10/26/amazoncom-marches-ahead-in-quest-to-take-over-worl.aspx|10/26/2013|-1|"Wal-Mart"|2|Why are investors excited?Amazon.com continues to outperform the market thanks to tremendous top line sales growth. For the third quarter, Amazon.com's sales increased 24% to $17.1 billion and exceeded analyst expectations of $16.8 billion. This increase is sharply contrasted by relatively soft retail data; for example, brick and mortar competitors Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) are expected to report revenue growth of less than 3% in next month's earnings releases.|A TTM P/S ratio of 2.3 doesn't sound like a bargain against the backdrop of Wal-Mart and Target's ratios of 0.5, but it is important to remember that Amazon.com also competes against companies like Apple, Netflix, and Rackspace Holdings in a range of mobile device, digital media, and cloud computing businesses. Each of these companies trades at a P/S ratio higher than Amazon.com's.|Failure of management to remain on the present course or game-changing competition shifts from retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target would be valid reasons to rethink this investment thesis, but short-term valuation concerns should not scare away long-term investors.

Things changed dramatically over the next seven years; in 2007, 12 financial services brands were in the top 100.|Citi and American Express each climbed from 2000 to 2007, and Citi was the 11th most valuable brand in the world before the financial crisis, with a brand value of $23.4 billion. In total, there were 10 companies in the financial services industry with brands that made it into the top 50, including AIG, which was taken over by the U.S. government less than one year later.|As you can see, American Express topped the chart as the best brand in the financial services industry, with a commanding lead over the nearest competitor, HSBC. Also interesting, it had a brand value that was nearly double the combined value of Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA) , the other two leading credit card companies.

Recent news from industry peers haven't been too great, with DuPont's (NYSE: DD) chemical business delivering a lackluster third quarter and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) missing Street estimates on lower sales volumes across key businesses.|The chink in Huntsman's armor Judging by DuPont's just-released quarterly report, Huntsman's pigments business will likely drag the company's profits down in the third quarter. While sales from DuPont's performance chemicals division fell 1% year over year, operating profit from the division slumped 39%, reflecting the substantial impact of high titanium ore cost.|Huntsman investors can take heart because 60% of the company's titanium dioxide, or TiO2, is produced using the inexpensive sulfate ore. So Huntsman's pigments division may not be hit as badly as DuPont's performance chemicals business. But, there's another problem. Unlike DuPont, which largely sells to customers in North America, more than half of Huntsman's TiO2 sales come from Europe. Since the region isn't in the best shape right now, expect a dismal third quarter from Huntsman's pigments business.|Moreover, as I write this, news of DuPont announcing a similar move for its TiO2 business is pouring in. Naturally, analysts and investors should have several questions for Huntsman, especially about how the company plans to take on the world's largest TiO2 producer. Watch this space to get an insight into Huntsman's numbers, growth catalysts, challenges, and plans for the future.

DuPont said post-deal its shareholders would own stock of both a high-growth specialty chemicals firm and the spinoff, which will have strong cash flow and powerful market share even if growth may lag.|"This separation will advance the transformation of DuPont and result in two strong, highly competitive companies," DuPont Chair and CEO Ellen Kullman said in a statement. "After separation, DuPont will have the optimum portfolio and will benefit from more consistent earnings growth and lower volatility, enhancing our ability to deliver more sustained growth and invest in future opportunities."|Kullman said she expects the two companies post-separation to pay dividends that combined would equal DuPont's dividend at the time of the split. Post-split DuPont will be focused on agriculture, nutrition, advanced materials and bio-based industrial products.|The announcement came hours after DuPont rival Dow Chemical(DOW) more than doubled its divestiture goal to $3 billion in asset sales by the end of 2014. DuPont and Dow have both in recent years tried to shift their businesses away from petroleum-based products and base chemicals, with Dow acquiring Rohm and Haas for $18.8 billion in 2008 and shedding assets including Morton Salt and various catalyst and polypropylene businesses in the years since.|DuPont, meanwhile, has done deals including its $6.3 billion purchase of Danish food enzyme maker Danisco in 2011, while marking its performance coatings segment for sale.

Two of the most successful treatments launched so far have been Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) Zytiga and Medivation's (NASDAQ: MDVN) Xtandi, which was developed with Japanese drug firm Astellas.|J&J's Zytiga stands to lose its advantageThe Food and Drug Administration approved Zytiga as a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, in April 2011. That approval gave Johnson's Zytiga front runner status as a third-line treatment for patients who had previously started and failed on treatment with generic Taxotere, known as docetaxol.|Fool's final takeMedivation and Johnson both have robust sales opportunity that may translate into blockbuster revenue from Xtandi and Zytiga, respectively. But, the two may face new competition from potential challengers including Exelixis' Cometriq and Oncogenex's custirsen. Bristol's Yervoy may also eventually win some of the market, and Sanofi continues to hope its Taxotere successor Jevtana will continue to capture sales.|Regardless, Medivation seems poised to take some of the share that otherwise would have been heading to Johnson and that could mean hundreds of millions in additional annual sales. You'll need to keep watching to see if the FDA follows through on granting Medivation approval for the pre-chemo indication.

The remainder of the settlement is for representation and warranty claims associated with loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased between 2000 and 2008.|In the announcement, JPMorgan noted that the settlements "are an important step toward a broader resolution of the firm's MBS-related matters with governmental entities, and reflect significant efforts by the Department of Justice and other federal and state governmental agencies."|In its third-quarter earnings announcement, JPMorgan noted that it had set aside $9.2 billion for litigation reserves, and it was reported that it had also reached a settlement with the Justice Department for $13 billion last weekend.

Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Merck over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|Stats on Merck|When will Merck earnings grow again?In recent months, analysts have cut their views on Merck earnings, reducing third-quarter estimates by $0.02 per share and pushing down their full-year 2014 projections by $0.15 per share. The stock has also moved down slightly, falling 2% since late July.|Merck's second-quarter earnings announcement in July showed the successes and challenges that the pharma giant has faced recently. The company managed to beat earnings estimates by a penny per share, but double-digit sales declines led to generally accepted accounting principles earnings getting cut almost in half. Asthma drug Singulair was responsible for just about all of those declines, with Merck's stable of other approved drugs failing to pick up the slack. Moreover, just as AbbVie must face the coming loss of patent protection for its key drug Humira, Merck has to deal with patents on major drugs Zetia, Vytorin, and Nasonex all expiring within the next three to four years, opening up more generic competition down the road.|As a result, Merck has scurried to get replacement drugs into its pipeline. Yet pipeline efforts have led to increased research and development expenses, raising Merck's total costs well above those of Pfizer and other industry rivals like Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline. High expenses have led Merck to announce massive layoffs, but some question whether a smaller workforce can pull the company back to health.|Strategic partnerships could help Merck move forward with its pipeline development. Last month, Merck added to its ongoing relationship with AstraZeneca to develop Merck's MK-1775 experimental cancer drug. The move should allow Merck to focus on more promising cancer treatments, such as its vintafolide ovarian-cancer treatment in phase 3 studies in the U.S., as well as its MK-3475 drug for metastatic melanoma.|In the Merck earnings report, watch to see how the company responds to its massive challenges.

However, like many companies, Coke could not escape from the volatility of the stock market. Since the middle of May, Coke has dropped from around $43 per share to $38 per share. Recently, the company reported growing quarterly profit and volume, which could be considered good news for investors. More importantly, Coke also mentioned that it was on track to double its system revenue since 2010.|Decent volume growth but negative currency impactIn the third quarter of 2013, Coca-Cola reported decent comparable revenue growth at 4% and operating income growth of 8%, excluding the impact of currency exchange and the de-consolidation of the Phillipines and Brazillian bottling operations in 2013 . The legendary Coca-Cola brand stayed strong, leading to the 2% increase in global volume growth. Consequently, the company delivered as many as 181 billion servings this quarter. However, its operating income dropped by as much as 12% mainly due to the declining value of currencies in many emerging economies. In the fourth quarter, the company expected that the currency exchange would have a 5%-6% negative impact on its comparable operating income .|The growth in volume is definitely a positive sign. The global volume increase of the Coca-Cola brand means that Coca-Cola is still able to thrive among the increasing world population. The company believes in the huge potential of the emerging markets as the middle class is growing quite rapidly. CEO and Chairman Muhtar Kent mentioned that very healthy growth will be supported by one billion new members of the middle class by 2020.|PepsiCo's shareholder value could be unlocked by business separationWhile Coca-Cola is on track to deliver its 2020 Vision of doubling its system revenue, the No.2 global leader in soft drinks PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) could unlock shareholder value by separating its beverage and snack segments. The soft drink business is strong and sustainable, but it is not growing as fast as PepsiCo's snacks . In the third quarter, while the snack business experienced 3% organic volume growth, the organic volume growth of PepsiCo's beverages was only 1%. The business separation idea was from activist investor and large PepsiCo shareholder Nelson Peltz. He thought that it would be best for PepsiCo to acquire Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ) , and then spin off the beverage business.|My Foolish bottom lineBoth Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, with their global leading positions in the soft drink market and their strong presences in emerging economies, will continue to benefit shareholders over the long run. I think PepsiCo will rise much higher in the near future if it implements Nelson Peltz's ideas for corporate restructuring.

This move could be caused by a number of things today, one of which may be a report that Dollar General is actually the lowest-cost store among the discount retailers. Kantar Retail conducted a survey that indicated Wal-Mart was $0.12 more expensive than Dollar General when comparing the total price of a basket of the same products at each store. Family Dollar was a close third, while Target's basket cost nearly 50% more than the top two stores.|The other reason is that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) once again posted a great quarter in terms of revenue growth, which may be an indication that Wal-Mart is once again losing market share to the online retailer. Although Amazon is still posting a quarterly loss, the revenue growth is extremely impressive and many believe Amazon could flip the switch from growth to profit anytime it wants, but has maintained the growth strategy and thus shows a loss each quarter.|Wal-Mart's price moves today shouldn't concern any longtime shareholder, as the survey results were very close and unlikely to change many consumers' minds. As for Amazon, the company has been around long enough that the possible damage it could do to Wal-Mart is likely baked into the stock price. That doesn't mean one retailer is better than the other. When it comes to Wal-Mart and Amazon, it all depends on what you're looking for: stable, slow, consistent growth, or volatile, erratic, but possibly explosive growth. Neither one is wrong nor right; it just depends on what you are comfortable with.

The stock has also destroyed traditional retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT) in both the long and short runs.|Traditional retail giants Wal-Mart and Target most certainly squeeze more profit out of their revenue streams than Amazon ever did. Amazon often runs near breakeven on the GAAP bottom line. Both Target and Wal-Mart aim for net margins between 3% and 4%. But then, the big-box retail veterans also settle for sales growth near the 3% mark while Amazon delivers more than 20% on that metric.|The low-margin strategy may sound scar,y but it hasn't stopped Amazon investors from making a killing, compared to the modest long-term gains in Target, Wal-Mart, or the Dow:

In stark contrast, if Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) reported a loss, the stock would plummet. How did Amazon earn its right to report losses?|Wal-Mart, on the other hand, delivers a healthy stream of profits for investors.|Wal-Mart is a consistent cash cow. Both revenue and EPS are growing fairly consistently. Even more, Wal-Mart is able to pay investors a meaningful 2.5% dividend yield. In fact, the company's cash flow is so consistent that Wal-Mart has been able to deliver 37 consecutive annual dividend increases.|To compete effectively with Wal-Mart, Amazon has to break some rules. One of those rules is forgoing profits for the sake of aggressive pricing and spending -- two strategies that have helped Amazon rapidly gain market share. As long as Amazon is gaining significant market share, investors will be happy with the company's strategy.

AT&T reported total sales of $32.2 billion, a 2.2% year-over-year increase that was within a rounding error of meeting analyst targets. On the bottom line, $0.66 of adjusted earnings per share came in a penny above Wall Street estimates. That's a 6.5% annual growth rate -- stronger than the top-line jump, thanks to a generous share-buyback program.|And yet, AT&T's stock has faltered.

That's more than double the year-ago period's additions but weak compared to Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , which recently reported 927,000 new subscribers for the same period.|In other words, Verizon is wiping the floor with AT&T when it comes to attracting new customers.

AT&T still boasts 109 million wireless customers, including 72 million of the high-margin postpaid variety. Moreover, AT&T sold smartphones to 1.2 million new subscribers this quarter.

That's not a bad trade-off, given the much fatter margins of smartphone-class data plans.|In the end, I don't expect this minor discount on AT&T shares to stick very hard. Come back next week, and you'll find it difficult to discern any lasting effects on AT&T stock prices from this hiccup.|The long-term story is still the same: AT&T battles Verizon for American wireless supremacy, while lesser lights regroup around the feet of these two giants.

Now that the shutdown crisis is over, investors in Rockwell Collins hope that the strength in commercial and military aircraft manufacturing will translate to success for the aviation and communication systems maker, especially given the importance that Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) have to the company.|Like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and many other companies that rely on the Defense Department for revenue, Rockwell Collins has seen headwinds from sequestration and the impact it has had on government spending. Yet Rockwell has managed to make the most of its military business while also reaping the rewards of extremely favorable conditions in the commercial aircraft market, where purchasers are flocking to newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft designs to cut their own operating costs. Can the good times continue? Let's take an early look at what's been happening with Rockwell Collins over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|The even bigger opportunity for Rockwell Collins, though, lies in the commercial space. CEO Ortberg was instrumental in getting Rockwell's systems in place in civilian aircraft for Boeing as well as planes from rival Airbus and Bombardier. Rockwell believes that higher Boeing 787 production and initial Airbus A350 sales should help send its sales of original equipment in its air-transport aircraft segment up by percentages in the low-teens in fiscal 2014. Boeing's success should also boost aftermarket sales.|In the Rockwell Collins earnings report, watch to see whether the company's results match up with its preliminary guidance from last month.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/10/24/will-the-787-dreamliner-be-profitable-at-last-for.aspx|10/24/2013|1|"Boeing"|0|Will the 787 Dreamliner Be Profitable at Last for Boeing?|There's been a lot of media attention around the 787 Dreamliner, a technologically advanced passenger jet designed and built by Boeing (NYSE: BA) . On the positive side, the Dreamliner has made history as the fastest-selling jet ever, thanks to an innovative design that allows the Dreamliner to also claim the title of the world's most fuel-efficient airliner. On the other hand, since the aircraft launched in 2011, Dreamliners have been plagued with malfunctions, sometimes in very headline-worthy ways, such as by catching fire. One fact that's largely slipped under the radar is that it costs Boeing more money to build a Dreamliner than the company sells them for, meaning that, so far, the aerospace giant has lost billions building and selling Dreamliners. When Boeing released its third-quarter earnings Wednesday, the company provided some clues that the Dreamliner program could be profitable at last, and sooner than expected.|How Boeing counts costsWhen Boeing creates a new airline design, the costs are heavily front-loaded while the benefits accrue toward the end of the design's commercial lifetime. Modern jetliners are arguably the most technically demanding machines built in the world, and developing them isn't cheap. Boeing spends more than $3 billion every year in research and development alone, but it also costs Boeing quite a bit to set up the facilities to actually manufacture the planes. Boeing also has to undergo a learning curve as it begins production of a new plane design, refining the manufacturing process, working out problems, and gaining efficiency as it gains experience. That means that the first plane built is a lot more expensive to make than the hundredth plane, which in turn is more expensive than the thousandth.|Boeing can't charge several times more for the first plane it sells, however, because airlines would simply delay their orders until costs went down. Add the fact that early customers are typically rewarded with steep discounts from the list price in return for supporting the launch of a new plane, and Boeing can actually lose tens of millions of dollars for each plane that it sells early in the aircraft design's life cycle. However, once Boeing has already made investments in its production capacity and the new aircraft's kinks have been ironed out, it can manufacture the planes for far less than it sells them, allowing the later components in a production block to more than earn back the cost of creating earlier planes.|Accordingly, Boeing employs a rare bookkeeping practice called program accounting. Under program accounting, the company doesn't look at the financials of building a single plane, but the financial picture of an entire block of plane deliveries in a program. Boeing estimates a program block's total costs and revenues, taking into account anticipated future cost reductions and future sales prices, and then averages out the program's expected profit margin for each plane. Essentially, program accounting allows Boeing to pull expected profits forward onto its books by pushing early costs out into the future, an accounting measure called "deferred production" that enables booking a small profit from plane sales that were actually losses for the company on an individual basis.Later on, once a program becomes established and production cost savings are realized, the big profits from selling mature planes go to pay back this deferred production.|Chart courtesy of Boeing|Is the Dreamliner turning a corner?While new 787 Dreamliner sales haven't been recorded as losses on an accounting basis, each plane sold does cost Boeing millions in cash flow, requiring the company to burn cash from other revenue sources to keep the program afloat until it can support itself. Boeing investors are looking forward to that inflection point where each new plane sold brings in enough profit to begin to pay back deferred production costs, rather than digging the company deeper into the hole. During Boeing's third-quarter earnings call, company execs gave investors some good news and some bad.|First, the good. Boeing confirmed that plans to increase production of the Dreamliner from seven planes per month today to 10 per month were on track, and also announced plans to raise production rates even further, to 12 planes per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end of this decade. Boeing believes that faster production clip will allow 787 sales to start breaking even in 2015, turning the corner and beginning to earn a profit and pay off deferred production in 2016. That's a much sooner turning point than I expected, and implies that incremental Dreamliner sales will turn profitable after only about 500-600 deliveries. Since Boeing estimated the global demand for Dreamliners at more than 1,700 planes over the next 20 years, that leaves the program a lot of room to bring in bumper profits.|Now, the bad. Boeing raised the total estimated cost of deferred production by 25%, from $20 billion to $25 billion, meaning that the company is going to have to spend another $5 billion before it starts actually making any money from the already expensive Dreamliner project. These are additional costs that few outside Boeing expected. The use of program accounting allows Boeing to be very vague on the financial details of a program so long as the entire program is in the black, but requires more specifics if the program is expected to take a loss. Boeing can avoid projecting a loss by simply inflating the number of planes in an accounting block, adding more profitable planes on the back end to compensate for higher costs on the front end. That's exactly what it did, adding 200 planes to the accounting block for a new total of 1,300. These are planes that, as a group, will be sold at profit margins close to or at zero, in the "very low single digits," according to CFO Greg Smith.|How you look at these numbers will affect whether Boeing looks like a good investment today or not. According to Boeing, the additional $5 billion in deferred production is a good thing, a sign that the company is investing heavily in production capacity ramp-up that will allow it to build and sell more Dreamliners more affordably, bringing that tantalizing turning point ever closer. On the other hand, this story will hold only if Boeing can deliver on its promises. The company has struggled with execution before: The first deliveries of 787 Dreamliners to customers were more than three years late, a delay that cost both Boeing and its airline clients dearly. According to the Seattle Times, the 787 development project itself experienced shocking cost overruns, rising from an expected $5.8 billion to more than $15 billion. If this new $5 billion expense for the Dreamliner program doesn't materialize as investment in real productive capacity, it simply will be another unfortunate cost overrun that pushes the day the Dreamliner will be profitable further out into the future.|How Boeing could dominate a global recoveryWith the American markets reaching new highs, investors and pundits alike are skeptical about future growth. They shouldn't be. Many global regions are still stuck in neutral, and their resurgence could result in windfall profits for select companies. A recent Motley Fool report, "3 Strong Buys for a Global Economic Recovery," outlines three companies that could take off when the global economy gains steam. Click here to read the full report!|Well done and most informative. Someday, I think the 787 will be remembered as the first of its kind, the first commercial airliner whose fuselage and wings were built with carbon fiber rather than aluminum. That is a fundamental change to aircraft construction for so large a plane. Accordingly the challenges and costs to do so are unsurprisingly high. But the lessons learned by Boeing can be applied to bringing other new generation aircraft to market more quickly and affordably.|That's an optimistic point of view perhaps, but I think it applies if you invest for the long term in a company like Boeing (I don't hold shares in Boeing). Building commercial aircraft, computer chips and pharmaceuticals must be some of the most complex product creation and management tasks around, and the costs to do so continue to increase.

The five-year average net profit margin for the company is 12.8%, compared to the 6.6% net profit margin of Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) , its competitor with a $55.4 billion market capitalization. Whereas there has been a general but fairly inconsistent improvement in Caterpillar's net profit margin over the past five years, Joy Global has posted more consistent levels of improvement as can be seen in the table below:|In addition to beating out its largest publicly traded competitor in regard to its net profit margin, Joy Global's balance sheet is more attractive as well. As of its most recent fiscal quarter, the company had a current ratio of 2.03 compared to Caterpillar's 1.36. What this means is that, for each dollar in liabilities that Joy Global owes in the near future, it has $2.03 in assets that can likely be converted easily into cash in the near future.|The metrics of both companies indicate that they probably won't have any problems paying off what they owe in the short term, but what about what they owe in the long term? Well, looking at the long-term debt to equity ratios of both players, we see that Joy Global's metric of 0.42 is far better than the 1.46 sported by Caterpillar. Put simply, for every dollar in assets after subtracting liabilities that Joy Global has, it has only $0.42 in long-term debt. In juxtaposition, Caterpillar has $1.46 in long-term debt for each dollar in assets less liabilities. Generally speaking, this doesn't mean that Caterpillar will go bankrupt tomorrow. Rather, it suggests that if times become challenging for the industry, Joy Global will be better able to cope with its debt load than Caterpillar after keeping all else the same.|Foolish takeawayBased on a purely fundamental perspective, it appears as though Joy Global is the better company to play out of the two. Not only is it healthy, it's also cheaper than Caterpillar, which is trading at 13.45 times earnings. The biggest downside to the company involves its exposure to China -- about 18% of sales is derived there. As such, any substantial decline in the Chinese economy would likely impair the company's earnings significantly. However, if you believe that China's slump is temporary, then Joy Global's prospects should appeal particularly solid to you.

Yet even though many analysts pointed to encouraging news about the Chinese economy as driving the Dow higher, two of the stocks you'd expect to see gain the most from China's recovery, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) , didn't post significant gains compared to the Dow.|But Caterpillar stock has stalled this morning as the heavy-equipment manufacturer continues to consolidate after yesterday's disappointing earnings report. In particular, the timing of its acquisition of mining-equipment maker Bucyrus three years ago has turned out to be horrible in hindsight, as falling commodities prices have hit the mining industry and forced miners to delay capital-equipment purchases. A pick-up in general manufacturing activity might help lift prices of certain commodities higher, but it won't necessarily translate to greater activity in construction and infrastructure work. Those are the areas that Caterpillar most needs to see do well in order to get earnings moving in the right direction again, and until that part of the Chinese economy recovers, Caterpillar will have a hard time bouncing back.|General Electric, meanwhile, is also flatlining this morning. GE's more wide-ranging conglomerate business covers a far greater swath of industries than Caterpillar, although General Electric has identified the mining-equipment market as a potential driver of future growth. Unlike Caterpillar's, GE's stock has performed quite well recently, as its energy and aviation businesses have pulled a lot of the conglomerate's weight over the past year. A Chinese recovery would be one mark of success for General Electric, but GE also needs to see that strength translate to a broader global recovery that lifts key areas like Europe and the U.S. as well.

Varco's focus on products doesn't give it the same opportunities as more operationally focused competitors like Halliburton, but it also limits Varco's potential liability when things go wrong.|Most recently, Varco decided it would spin off its distribution and transmission unit from the rest of its business. The spinoff will serve the dual purpose of separating out a lower-margin segment from Varco's more lucrative operations while also allowing the unit to provide essential maintenance, repair, and operating supplies both to Varco and other companies throughout the industry. Just as General Electric and Halliburton have worked hard to find the right balance in their respective businesses, Varco's move should help it focus on its best prospects going forward.|Fool contributor Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

After many earnings reports today the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is trading 0.57% higher. A handful of industrial stalwarts have done their part to bring the markets higher. General Electric's (NYSE: GE) stock surged following its report, Boeing posted strong third-quarter results yesterday, and Ford (NYSE: F) took the baton and ran with it this morning. Here are some of the highlights.|Back inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average, General Electric is trading a full percent higher today. Investors were happy with General Electric's third quarter, even though its revenue growth fell short of expectations and earnings per share barely met estimates. Typically the markets' short-term thinking would send General Electric's stock price down on the news, but in an eyebrow-raising move, its stock surged after Friday's announcement. I think the market has it right this time: General Electric is improving its focus and profitability.|Industrial margins jumped 120 basis points to 15.4% and are proof that General Electric's theme of simplifying operations is working. As management continues to focus on fewer business segments its industrial portfolio has become much stronger, which should bode well for investors going forward. In addition to a more focused and profitable operation, General Electric continues to return value to shareholders. It paid out nearly $6 billion in dividends and repurchased $8 billion of its stock in 2013. As long as GE continues to return value to shareholders and improve its operations, it's an intriguing industrial investment going forward.

Yet even though many analysts pointed to encouraging news about the Chinese economy as driving the Dow higher, two of the stocks you'd expect to see gain the most from China's recovery, Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) , didn't post significant gains compared to the Dow.|General Electric, meanwhile, is also flatlining this morning. GE's more wide-ranging conglomerate business covers a far greater swath of industries than Caterpillar, although General Electric has identified the mining-equipment market as a potential driver of future growth. Unlike Caterpillar's, GE's stock has performed quite well recently, as its energy and aviation businesses have pulled a lot of the conglomerate's weight over the past year. A Chinese recovery would be one mark of success for General Electric, but GE also needs to see that strength translate to a broader global recovery that lifts key areas like Europe and the U.S. as well.

The company ranked among the top 10 Fortune 500 companies by revenue for 2013 and is currently the third-largest company on the Forbes Global 2000 rankings. While it was originally a manufacturing concern producing Thomas Edison's many electrical creations, General Electric has over the years diversified into many other areas through a combination of innovations and acquisitions, and it now manages operations in more than 100 countries. Its product lines range from electrical turbines to jet engines to solar panels to consumer lighting and beyond, making it a good indicator of the health of a highly interconnected and energy-intensive global economy.|Round one: endurance (dividend-paying streak)According to Dividata, Intel has been paying quarterly dividends since late 1992, for a continuous period of 20 years. That's a strong streak for a tech company, but the chipmaker falls far short of GE's streak -- Edison's legacy has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than a century. This one's an easy win for General Electric.|Winner: General Electric, 1-0.

However, the company's synergies are winding down, and it showed in the third quarter: Total medical-device sales fell 2% year over year. Johnson & Johnson will need to fuel a fire underneath its largest device branch, its orthopedics business, if it wants to turn around this trend.|Still, Johnson & Johnson has a big advantage over these competitors in its size and diversity.

Close|Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer may have missed some crucial technology trends, but he helped grow the company into a giant.&nbsp;|When investors discuss the legacy of Steve Ballmer, they often cite Microsoft's share drop from the heights of the bubbly 1990s. The company's stock price was soaring at a split-adjusted high of $59.56 just weeks before Ballmer took over as CEO in January 2000, and since that year, it has never closed above $40.|Even the Windows business, Microsoft's original cash cow, has more than doubled in sales since Ballmer became CEO. But that number doesn't tell the full story. In 2000, PCs were really the only computing device in town for most people, and Windows had more than 90 percent of the market. With the advent of smartphones and tablets, and Microsoft's complete failure to amass share there, Goldman Sachs estimated last year that Windows runs on just 19 percent of the computing devices consumers use.

It was just a fraction of the money the company spends on research and development. Last year, for instance, that totaled over $10 billion, but it did help build awareness around the company's SenseCam, which has since been licensed out to other companies.|By tracking and organizing a life in terms of data, people struggling to recall a moment will be able to refresh their thoughts, and gain some clarity. Bell notes he personally has no connection with the Alzheimer's Foundation, except to occasionally review research proposals, but Microsoft has worked with a memory clinic in the U.K. to incorporate the SenseCam into helping those with memory disorders.

And yes, I suppose, Nike (NYSE: NKE) is still the much bigger dog in the fight. Also, the market expectation that the company beat might not really be the investor expectation that it needed to beat; but leaving those three things aside, Under Armour looks untouchable.|Under Armour's three thingsIn its last fiscal year, Nike did pretty well for itself. In fact, it earned over $25 billion in revenue. Estimates for the global sporting apparel market last year put it around $135 billion, meaning that Nike had a 19% share of the whole thing. One out of every five dollars spent on sporting apparel went to Nike. Under Armour's share of the global market was just $1.83 billion -- 1.4% of the total market.|The company's solution to this is massive growth. With revenue up 153% over the last five years, Under Armour is gaining ground, but it still has a long way to go. Nike's domination means that the company is in a position to pigeonhole Under Armour and, even today, Under Armour succeeds when it sells itself as the high-end, technologically forward version of sports.|The company's trailing price-to-earnings ratio -- the cost to investors for $1 in income -- is over 60. Nike is trading at 26, and the industry average is just over 20. That means that the expectations for Under Armour's future are very high, indeed, and any misstep could send the stock down sharply.|The good newsEven with those hurdles, Under Armour may be in a position to succeed. While its plight is often seen in a David-Goliath light, that's not an entirely fair characterization. Under Armour can succeed without Nike failing. The niche that it inhabits is smaller, but much more profitable. Under Armour's gross margin was almost 10 percentage points higher than Nike's last year.|If you want to invest in growth, and a company that's managing its niche with mastery, Under Armour might be the company for you. If you want world domination, stick with Nike. Both companies look like long-term winners to me, though the ride for Under Armour might be a bit bumpier.|Back to that "world domination" thing...Nike is just one of the many American companies that's reaching beyond our borders to grab more cash.

With its revenue less than one-tenth of Nike's, my view is that Under Armour does not have what it takes to dent Nike's market share and reach its 2016 target of $4 billion in sales. The key lies in Nike's economies of scale advantage, which allows it to have an edge in product innovation by spreading R&D costs over a significantly larger revenue base. As it stands now, Under Armour has a 2% share of the footwear market, compared with a 60% market share for Nike.|While Nike is a leading global athletic apparel & footwear company, it also has its own set of issues, such as the China slowdown and gross margin pressure. Nike has become heavily dependent on China in recent years, with it contributing about 30% of its EBIT in fiscal 2012. While this market still has long-term potential, intense price competition and inventory over-supply following the Beijing Olympics have depressed both growth and margins for Nike in China.|Nike's gross margin has decreased from 46.3% in fiscal 2010 to 43.6% in fiscal 2013. Labor cost pressures and an unfavorable sales mix tilted toward lower margin geographic regions have contributed to the slide.

Yet given the extent to which AbbVie relies on its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira for sales, the company needs to figure out how to make the most of its remaining patent protection even with competitors Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) sporting popular alternative treatments of their own.|AbbVie's Humira is a true blockbuster drug, with sales of more than $9 billion just last year alone. But as many of its peers have already had to deal with major patent-protection expirations in recent years, AbbVie's turn will come in 2016, when Humira goes off-patent and becomes open to generic competition. At that point, it's likely that Amgen's Enbrel or Pfizer's Xeljanz will take over blockbuster status, and so by then, AbbVie needs to have seen some of its other initiatives pay off so that it can avoid an immense revenue drop that could devastate the company. Let's take an early look at what's been happening with AbbVie over the past quarter and what we're likely to see in its report.|AbbVie's second-quarter results made investors perfectly content with the company's prospects, as the report said all the right things. Sales rose by 4.4% from the year-ago quarter, beating expectations and helping to boost earnings above consensus figures as well. AbbVie also guided its expected range for full-year 2013 earnings to the top end of its previous guidance, and Humira managed to stave off an expected challenge from Pfizer's Xeljanz oral rheumatoid arthritis drug.|In the AbbVie earnings report, watch to see how well the company is able to move forward with alternatives beyond Humira. The success or failure of AbbVie's pipeline could make or break the company as it strives to compete against Pfizer, Amgen, and the rest of its rivals.

It released its previous quarterly release at 7 a.m. EDT. P&G will also hold an early conference call, scheduled to start at 8:30 a.m. EDT.|P&G's growth is most likely to come internationally, especially from emerging markets. Kimberly-Clark saw sales volumes rise 7% in its K-C International segment versus just 2% domestically. Similarly, Colgate-Palmolive grew Latin America unit volume by 5.5% and Asia unit volume by 11%, although currency impacts played a huge role in reducing overall revenue there. With both Colgate and Kimberly-Clark pushing hard to find growth in emerging markets, Procter & Gamble needs to post strong results there to keep pace.|Watch the valuationOne last thing for investors to keep in mind is that Procter & Gamble's current earnings multiple is relatively high. That's not a typical situation for P&G, but it suggests the company needs to produce impressive results to keep investors happy. Otherwise, a drop in Procter & Gamble's stock could send the entire Dow reeling tomorrow.|One thing that has helped Procter & Gamble hold up during tough years is its dividend.

Verizon Wireless also depended heavily on Internet devices like tablets for about 40 percent of its 927,000 net new subscribers in the third quarter.|Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint followed with their own versions of the early upgrade offer, but Verizon and AT&T were criticized by analysts and consumers for charging too much.|So far AT&T and Verizon have said that intensifying competition is attracting only their lowest-spending customers.|For now it seems to have the biggest impact on AT&T. But some analysts say the average estimate for T-Mobile customers may be too low and that it could beat Verizon's third-quarter phone subscriber growth of 481,000.

By comparison, Kroger (NYSE: KR) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) are two big players in the grocery business, and with margins of better than 2.5 % and 5.8 % respectively, Safeway isn't playing in the same league.|If investors don't think this is a big deal, consider that neither Kroger nor Wal-Mart uses more than 17% of its operating income on interest. With a large percentage of income being used on interest, Safeway has less than its peers to use on dividends, share repurchases, and growth investments.|Using this core operating cash flow figure, Safeway reported a decline of more than 13 % last quarter and a decline of almost 2% in the current quarter. If we look again at Kroger and Wal-Mart, both companies reported increases in core operating cash flow in their most recent quarterly reports.|The biggest problemWith a low margin, high interest costs, and declining cash flow you might expect that Safeway's stock would sell at a discount to some of its peers. Kroger and Wal-Mart each sell for around 14 times 2013 projected earnings. Both companies are expected to grow earnings by around 9%. This means that Safeway's competitors carry price-earnings-growth ratios of about 1.5.

While this may be a nice move for Wal-Mart, I don't see Wal-Mart being a major threat to PetSmart.|Wal-Mart has recently been trying to associate itself with a more discerning consumer. Despite what is depicted in commercials, I'd personally be outraged if a steak house bought my cut from Wal-Mart; am I the only one?|I digress, here's the point. Wal-Mart is synonymous with having the lowest prices, that's their moat, not quality. Whether it's food, or pet products, people will always think to go to Wal-Mart for a low cost option.|Is Whole Food's a threat?Like Wal-Mart's move with Pure Balance, Whole Food's (NASDAQ: WFM) move into pet food is a good move for them, but not a major threat to PetSmart. Whole Food's recently introduced Whole Paws, a natural and organic private-label pet product line.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) ironically came the closest with a gross margin of almost 29%. By comparison, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Kroger (NYSE: KR) managed margins of just 25% and 20%, respectively.|Amazon has been growing sales by 20% or more for the last several years. Kroger reported same-store sales growth of 3.3%, and of these companies, just Wal-Mart reported slower same-store sales growth in its domestic operations. With both Amazon and Kroger reporting stronger sales growth than Target, it's not a jump in logic to believe that if Target lowered prices somewhat, its sales could improve.|Wal-Mart's SG&A expenses came in at just over 19%. Kroger was even more efficient at about 15%. Amazon reported a higher SG&A percentage at over 28%, but as many people know, Amazon is spending plenty of money building warehouses and expanding furiously.|Amazon grew its operating cash flow by more than 40% year over year, Kroger reported a better than 6% increase, and Wal-Mart showed a better than 2% improvement. Given that each of these companies competes directly with Target, it's ironic that they each grew operating cash flow while Target's cash flow declined.

http://www.cnbc.com/id/101136583|10/24/2013|0|"Wal-Mart"|3|Delayed tax refunds, combined with rising gas prices and the expiration of the payroll tax cut, caused soft sales for several retailers earlier this year, notably Wal-Mart. According to IRS data, processed tax returns as of March 1 had fallen 13.1 percent, while those filed by March 29 were down 4.5 percent, highlighting the sharp drop in earlier returns.|On Wal-Mart's first-quarter earnings call, CEO and President Mike Duke attributed pressured sales to delayed refunds, which caused customers to put off discretionary purchases. The company's U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4 percent in the period, missing projections for flat growth. That followed a 2.6 percent same-store sales gain in the year-earlier quarter.|At the time, Bill Simon, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. stores, said that it had expected "to recover a reasonable portion of these tax refunds and had also assumed that customers would follow historical spending patterns with these funds. This did not materialize as we had anticipated."
